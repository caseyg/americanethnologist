Text: 

###Tables
Submit each table separately from the manuscript in its own Word document. Do not submit tables as PDFs, since they need to copyedited. Give each table a number and a short descriptive title (e.g., Table 1: Short descriptive title). Name the tables’ Word files using your name and the table number: Your Name Table 1, Your Name Table 2, and so on. In the manuscript, place bracketed callouts between paragraphs indicating where each table should be placed, like this: [Please insert Table 1 here]. In the text, point out each table to the reader once, usually in parentheses, like this: (see Table 1).

###Photos, maps, and other illustrations
Submit each image separately from the manuscript in its own TIF or JPG file. Do not embed images in the manuscript. Image files must be high resolution (at least 300 dpi) and large enough to print at 8 x 10 inches. If they do not meet these criteria, we cannot use them. Title the image files using your name and consecutive Arabic numerals: Your Name Figure 1, Your Name Figure 2, and so on. Each image needs a corresponding placement callout and reference in the main text, as with tables (see above).

In a separate document, submit captions for each image numbered to correspond with the image files: Figure 1, Figure 2. All captions should include a detailed description of the image (naming the who, what, when, and where), as well as a credit, like this:

>Figure 1. Crowds in Tahrir Square, Cairo, react with joy to the announcement that President Mubarak will step down, February 11, 2011. (Rick Loomis/Los Angeles Times/Polaris)

In some cases, longer captions are called for. They should not exceed three sentences. Begin with a sentence or sentence fragment that identifies the image. Then explain its significance, as in this example:

>Figure 2. A map of a cloudless Earth is juxtaposed with a second map of Earth reconstructed from reduced satellite data. The bottom map is meant to mimic the kind of image that astronomers might one day capture of faraway exoplanets. The map thus suggests that we are viewing something “other,” but in fact we are viewing a representation of ourselves. (Reproduced by permission from Nicholas B. Cowan et al., “Alien Maps of an Ocean-Bearing World,” Astrophysical Journal 700 [2]: 915–23. © 2009 American Astronomical Society)

All captions should be intelligible to someone who has not read the article, so please explain unfamiliar terms and identify any people to whom you refer.

###Permissions
You must submit written permissions for each image, including those you own and those owned by someone else. In each permission, the image’s owner must authorize AE to publish the image both in print and online. A permission must also be submitted for any table that is owned by someone else or is being reprinted.
