Title: Writing

----

Text: 

The journal aims to publish clear and precise prose that eschews unnecessary jargon, accessible to its broad readership that spans all of social and cultural anthropology.

Authors are requested to avoid using metacommunicative frames such as “In this article, I argue,” “I describe,” “I maintain,” and the like. Simply state your ideas upfront. Likewise, statements as “This article contributes to a growing body of anthropological scholarship” should be substituted with clear and precise statements of the theoretical contribution that the author is making. The text should make ideas the backbone of the arguments, rather than authors, publications, “literatures,” or “research.” These issues are particularly relevant in your abstract, where self-referential “noise” takes up valuable space.

The title and abstract are two of the most important aspects of an article, for two reasons: they are the only two elements of a submitted manuscript that invited reviewers see and on which they base their decision to review the manuscript or not; and, if the article is published, they are the elements of the article that are freely available to all readers online and that search engines utilize to identify the article, along with the keywords. Optimizing an article for search engines will greatly increase its chance of being viewed and cited in other works.

## Constructing a clear descriptive title and subtitle 

Search engines are constructed so as to identify in the title and subtitle of an article all the important words that define the topic it addresses. This is why it is crucial to choose a clear, accurate title and subtitle that feature search terms that readers are likely to use when looking for articles on a particular topic. Titles should be understandable to readers outside the discipline.

## Constructing a clear and engaging abstract

The abstract is a conduit to the article, in the sense that readers use it to decide whether to read the article. Thus, it should be clear, engaging, and precise, and explicitly state the article’s original contribution. The abstract can use words and short phrases from the article, although it should not repeat longer phrases or sentences, as readers are not fond of being made to read the same text twice.

## Carefully selecting keywords

Keywords enhance the article’s online discoverability. They should repeat words in the title, subtitle, and abstract, and should only include terms that perform an important analytic function in the body of the article.

The following are examples of well-written titles, abstracts, and lists of keywords that have been published in AE (reproduced with the authors’ permission):

> Wit and Greece's economic crisis: Ironic slogans, food, and antiausterity sentiments
Daniel M. Knight (published in AE 42.2, 2015)
> 
> Ironic slogans voice opposition to neoliberal austerity measures as people in western Thessaly, Greece, strive to account for dramatically increasing poverty and cultivate a sense of collective suffering in an era of economic crisis. The slogans are pinned to moments of socio-economic turmoil in recent Greek history, such as the 1941–1943 famine and the 1973 polytechnic uprising against military dictatorship. Through satire, they capture local and national attitudes toward the government’s current austerity policy and neoliberalism more generally. Drawing on powerful tropes of food, the slogans critique the experience of neoliberal reform, becoming sites of resistance and solidarity that reframe relations between local people, their government, and international creditors.

> The makeup of destiny: Predestination and the labor of hope in a Moroccan emigrant town
Alice Elliot (published in AE 43.3, 2016)
> 
> As young women in a Moroccan emigrant town search for suitable husbands, they frame seemingly irreverent practices such as using makeup and premarital romances as ways to precipitate their unknown conjugal destinies. This complex “labor of hope” flows from the Islamic precept of predestination, which, far from being a fatalistic backdrop to social life, compels people to act in the human world in view of a future that has already been divinely determined. Here, destiny effectively “folds” Islam into the very texture of mundane practices that, on the surface, may seem not just distant from Islam but even antithetical to it. This phenomenon obliges us to recast Max Weber's argument on predestination and action, as well as to reconsider current anthropological debates on “everyday Islam.” [destiny, migration, hope, courtship, future, Islam, Morocco]
