Title: Text module

----

Text: 

**Manuscript form and length** Double-space all text and use a 12-point font throughout, including for headings, block quotations, the reference list, and endnotes. Set all margins at one inch (2.45 cm) and do not right-justify the text. Use only formatting that is essential to the meaning of the text. Manuscripts must not exceed the generous 11,000-word limit, including notes and references but excluding the title, author’s name and contact details, and abstract.

**Title page** Include the article’s title and the author’s name, institutional affiliation, current mailing address, and e-mail. Provide any acknowledgments at the bottom of this page.

**Abstract** Each [deleted adjective] article must begin with an abstract of 100 to 125 words that summarizes precisely the argument developed in the manuscript. The abstract should end with a bracketed list of up to seven keywords or phrases.

All authors of accepted manuscripts are strongly encouraged to provide article abstracts into one or more languages relevant to the topic and/or expanded audience of the article, as long as the abstract is translated by a native speaker of the language and can be properly copyedited. Translations should only be submitted after the English version of the abstract has been copyedited.

**Style** American Ethnologist follows The Chicago Manual of Style, 16th edition. For spelling, the reference is Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary, 11th edition, which uses US (rather than British) spellings; wherever Merriam-Webster’s lists variant spellings, use the first one given.

**Citations and references** Cite according to the author-date system set forth in chapter 15 of the Chicago Manual. Place the citation in parentheses and include the author’s name and the source’s year of publication, with no intervening punctuation, like this: (Herzfeld 2004). For quotations or extensive paraphrases, include the pages numbers preceded by a comma: (Herzfeld 2004, 146–7).

On the reference list, include every source cited in the text and no others, listed alphabetically by author (in the case of multiple entries by the same author, list them chronologically, from oldest to most recent). The references must begin on a new page; do not embed them in the endnotes. The layout is as follows:

> Bessire, Lucas, and David Bond. 2014. “Ontological Anthropology and the Deferral of Critique.” American Ethnologist 41 (3): 440–56.
> Comaroff, Jean. 1996. “The Empire’s Old Clothes: Fashioning the Colonial Subject.” In Cross-Cultural Consumption: Global Markets, Local Realities, edited by David Howes, 19–38. London: Routledge.
> Herzfeld, Michael. 2004. Cultural Intimacy: Social Poetics in the Nation-State. 2nd ed. London: Routledge. First published 1997.
> Daser, Deniz. 2014. “AE Interviews Catherine Lutz (Brown University).” American Ethnologist website, May 9. Accessed [Month Day, Year]. http://americanethnologist.org/2014/ae-interviews-catherine-lutz-brown-university.

Use hanging indent in the list of references, not tabs or spaces, to offset the second and subsequent lines.

**Endnotes** AE uses endnotes, not footnotes. They should be brief and directly relevant to the text, and limited to twelve. In the main text, place endnote reference numbers at the ends of sentences only, using Arabic numerals.

**Book reviews** Book review manuscripts should be a maximum of 1,000 words and should follow the same stylesheet as article manuscripts. Reviews should include no notes and preferably no citations and references. If citations are essential, they should be limited to two.

Information at the top of the first page should provide bibliographic information for the book and the reviewer’s name and affiliation data as in the following example:

> Gifts: A Study in Comparative Law. Richard Hyland. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009. 708 pp.
> JANE I. GUYER
> Johns Hopkins University

Reviews should be addressed to an audience of anthropologists who are not area experts and provide a sketch of the strengths and weaknesses of the book. Book reviews accepted for publication are edited, copyedited, and proofread.

Please send the book review manuscript as an attachment to (email: aebookreviews@gmail.com).
