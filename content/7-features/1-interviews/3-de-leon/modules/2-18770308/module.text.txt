Title: Intro

----

Text: *AES is excited to feature several plenary speakers at the spring 2016 conference, including Jason De León from the University of Michigan. Much of De León’s work has taken a four-field approach integrating archaeological and ethnographic methods to study undocumented migration along the U.S.-Mexico border, the suffering and resilience of migrant border crossers, and the objects that they leave behind. His book based on this research, *The Land of Open Graves: Living and Dying on the Migrant Trail* (University of California Press), was recently published in 2015. He joins the AES conference to talk about his new research into the experiences of Honduran migrants in Mexico.*
