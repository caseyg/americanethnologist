**COVID-19 Delay**

Due to the coronarvirus crisis the review process at American Ethnologist is taking longer than normal. The global community of anthropologists we rely on to provide peer reviews have been unable to accept new review invitations or meet existing deadlines. The editors and publishers of AE respect reviewers’ need for more time to submit reviews. The review process has therefore slowed. We appreciate the patience and understanding of authors as we all do the best we can during these challenging circumstances.

###Submission Guidelines

Manuscripts submitted to AE should not be under consideration elsewhere or have been published in any form. All manuscripts are reviewed anonymously. Please submit your manuscript online via (link: https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/americananthro-ae text: Manuscript Central). A paper copy is not required.

Image files and supporting documentation (captions, credits, permissions) may be uploaded at the time of submission or sent to journal.americanethnologist@gmail.com.

Authors are encouraged to suggest scholars who might review the manuscript, providing their institutional affiliations and e-mail addresses. They may also indicate scholars whom they prefer not to review the manuscript. The editor is not bound by these suggestions but will respect them whenever possible. Suggested reviewers should not present a conflict of interest; for example, they should not be employed at the same institution as the author or be closely involved in the author’s research.
