Text: *AE* partners with (link: http://sapiens.org text: Sapiens), an editorially independent online publication of the Wenner-Gren Foundation. Dedicated to popularizing anthropological research to an international, general-interest audience, *Sapiens* publishes feature essays, short opinion pieces, short narratives from the lab or field, photo essays, and more. Authors are encouraged to consider reworking their contributions to *AE* into a piece for Sapiens.
