**Alize Arican** is a doctoral candidate in Anthropology at the University of Illinois at Chicago, with a concentration in Gender and Women’s Studies. She holds a B.A. in Political Science from Boğaziçi University in Istanbul, Turkey, and an M.A. in Anthropology from the University of Illinois at Chicago. Her broad research interests are state-led urban development, everyday forms of resident activism and care, temporality, migration, and claims to urban citizenship and futures. She specifically traces the unfolding of what the ruling Justice and Development Party calls an “urban transformation project” in the Tarlabaşı neighborhood of Istanbul, Turkey. She explores the extended temporality of urban development in Tarlabaşı as a site of possibilities in which residents can negotiate, rearticulate, and shape the future of their neighborhood. Her work has been supported by various departments and research institutes at the University of Illinois at Chicago, as well as Kadir Has University Istanbul Studies Center, and the Humanities Without Walls Consortium. She has served as a graduate collaborator and project advisor for the Istanbul portion of the interdisciplinary, multi-sited project entitled “Political Ecology as Practice: A Regional Approach to the Anthropocene,” funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.

**Brittany Birberick** is a doctoral candidate in the Anthropology Department at the University of California, Berkeley. Her research, in Johannesburg, South Africa, examines the temporality of urban transformation through close attention to declining industry in Jeppestown, one of the earliest developed areas of the city. The project draws on historical and ethnographic methods to examine how key sites in the area have transformed or failed to transform according to narratives of development, dilapidation, and rejuvenation. At a time when local and global social, economic, and political forces are influencing a re-imaging of the remaining colonial and apartheid structure of the city, she is interested in the way expectations for the future, work, housing, and kinship are being reconfigured. She has also collaborated with a South African art photographer who grew up in one of the informal buildings in Jeppestown to examine ways of seeing urban space, and she is interested more broadly in the way image making and artistic practice intersects with anthropological research.

**Gabrielle Cabrera** is a first-year PhD student in Anthropology at Rutgers University. Gabrielle completed her BA at University of California, Merced where she was surrounded by a community of activists and scholars who encouraged her to think deeply and critically about teaching for justice, politics of (mis)recognition, and diversity discourse. Her work examines citizenship, the political economy of diversity discourse, questions of solidarity, and the neoliberalization of universities. Specifically, she aims to center the “Dreamer” narrative by interrogating how universities deploy and commodify the undocumented experience. Gabrielle grounds analysis in critical feminist and decolonizing methodologies and hope that such approaches provide alternative ways for researchers interested in migrant “illegality,” specifically, those who fit the “Dreamer” criteria, a guideline to shift away from reinforcing the “good immigrant” or “model minority” narrative.

**Grace Carey** is originally from Flint, MI and graduated with a bachelor's degree in Anthropology and Sociology from the University of Michigan-Flint in 2014. She is currently pursuing graduate studies in Anthropology and is a PhD candidate at Princeton University. Grace's work focuses on the dynamics of movement, law, and placemaking amongst Charismatic Catholic intentional communities in Southeastern Michigan and a privately owned Catholic town in Southwest Florida. She is interested in how these religious communities both create place that is mobile and how these particular forms of placemaking shape their experience and engagement with larger US legal systems. Ultimately her work speaks to issues of mobility, placemaking, utopia, and democracy in the US context. She will be doing fieldwork in Florida during 2018.

**Bryan Dougan** is a PhD student in the Department of Anthropology at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. His ethnographic work considers the ways in which humanitarian and global health knowledge and standards shape the practices surrounding psychiatric care in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Taking the urban as the site of psychiatric practice, his project seeks to examine how patients, families, doctors, and global health researchers grapple with providing care and conducting research in a rapidly developing African city. Originally from Baltimore, he holds a bachelor’s degree from Franklin & Marshall College and a master’s in public health from Johns Hopkins University.

**Saudi Garcia** is a third year doctoral student in the programs in Anthropology and Culture and Media at New York University. She is interested in the anthropology of telecommunications and digital media, the anthropology of race and the anthropology of capitalism. Her dissertation project frames Dominican women’s engagement with the natural hair movement as a site of emergent logics of racialized embodiment, transnational black feminist politics, informal entrepreneurship and ethnic media production. She is interested in the ways that entrepreneurs, micro-bloggers, marketers and artists construct and disseminate images of the black body in the Dominican Republic. Saudi is a documentary filmmaker and organizer with the La Sala Collective, a group dedicated to dismantling anti-black racism in the Spanish-speaking Caribbean community in New York City.

**Alison Hanson** is a PhD student in Cultural Anthropology at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Her interests include gender, social movements, justice, sexual violence, embodiment, and intimacy in South Asia and the United States. Alison’s current research examines how Indian feminist projects against sexual violence enact visions of gender justice both within and beyond the law. Specifically, she has conducted preliminary fieldwork with NGOs, lawyers, scholars, and student activists in New Delhi to explore how feminist politics manifest in different social spheres. She investigates the creative forms of action and solidarity building that undergird Indian women’s politics through a transnational and intersectional feminist lens. She comes to these research interests after working for women’s empowerment with fair trade artisans in India and through her own personal involvement in social justice advocacy. Alison is committed to engaged scholarship and producing knowledge that can be useful for multiple publics both in and outside the academy. She received an MA in Anthropology and a Graduate Certificate in Women’s and Gender Studies from the University of Colorado, Boulder and a BA in Business Economics from UCLA.

**Ognjen Kojanic** is currently a doctoral candidate at the University of Pittsburgh Department of Anthropology. He holds a bachelor’s degree in Ethnology and Anthropology from the University of Belgrade and a master’s degree in Sociology and Social Anthropology from the Central European University. In his doctoral research (generously supported by grants from the National Science Foundation, the Social Science Research Council, and the University of Pittsburgh European Studies Center) he focuses on the case of ITAS, a worker-owned machine tool company in Croatia. Drawing on economic and political anthropology, he studies the interface of economic ideologies, political mobilization, juridical practices, and state-imposed procedures in this case. The overall goal of this research is to investigate how an idea and practice of ownership is articulated in ITAS as different from the idea and practice of property that has characterized the post-socialist transformation of political and economic relations in Croatia.

**Maria Menegaki** is a PhD student in Social and Cultural Anthropology at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona and is excited to be part of the AES Editorial Intern team. She received a BA in Geography and an MA in Social and Historical Anthropology at the University of the Agean. Religion, Education, Sacred Geography, Tourism and Popular Culture have been among her basic research interests so far. In terms of her MA thesis, she conducted a research related to Death and Cremation in Greece. She highlighted social change and power relations as they are revealed by the study of cremation and discussed how the body as an object of power is transformed into an active subject of cultural resistance. Her current project explores the movement of free, libertarian education in Catalonia and her aim is to better understand such socio-political movements,`​ contribute to the related literature by inquiring an understanding from below and offer a rich empirical analysis which could later be applied.

**Peter Soles Muirhead**, a PhD student in anthropology and diaspora studies at the University of Toronto, received cultural psychiatry training at McGill, an MSc in anthropology at Toronto, and an Honours BA in anthropology and linguistics at Simon Fraser University. He is interested in the global networks, history, politics, and variation of mental health knowledge and practice. He is also committed to the ethnography and history of psychiatric consumer-survivors in Europe and North America. At the AES, Peter hopes to meaningfully expand and deepen the inclusivity, reflexivity, and genres of dissemination that link anthropology to the broader world. His dissertation research approaches French ethnopsychiatry and its relationship to the longstanding Franco-Turc diaspora in neighborhood and clinical settings. This work addresses transnational medical politics, ethno-religious hierarchies, and secularisms, as well as ethics, recognition, and imperial durabilities in the absence of an ex-colonial relationship. Originally from the British Columbia interior, Peter has also conducted mental health archival research and worked as a consulting medical anthropologist in Toronto.

**Sarah Riccardi-Swartz** is a PhD candidate in sociocultural anthropology at New York University, where she also completed the graduate certificate program in Culture and Media. Her dissertation research in the Appalachian Mountains is with a community of Russian Orthodox Christians. Her work primarily looks at the politics of the digital in religious places and spaces, and how religious media play roles in shaping the social imaginaries and transnational ideologies of practitioners, paying close attention to the effect media have on the local political economies and what that might say about the relationship between Russia and the United States. She is committed to scholarship inside and outside of the academy that emphasizes engaged work on the ever-expanding relationships between religion and media, political radicalism, regionalism, and gender and class inequalities. A longtime resident of the Midwest, Sarah received a M.A. and Bachelor of Arts in Religious Studies from Missouri State University.

**Victoria (Tori) Sheldon** is a PhD Candidate in the Department of Anthropology and Centre for South Asian Studies at the University of Toronto. While tourist companies celebrate Kerala as "God's Own Country", citizens are increasingly suspicious of environmental toxins and medical authority in this lush south Indian state, publicly declared as undergoing a “health crisis.” Converging with rapid social-economic development since the 1970s, Kerala's emergent middle-class has witnessed a shocking increase in chronic lifestyle diseases, including diabetes, cancer, and alcoholism. Based upon thirty months of fieldwork and language study, her PhD project analyzes the therapeutic practices and concomitant syncretic religious-scientific worldviews among Gandhian Nature Cure (prakriti jeevanam) healers and patient-cum-activists in the region. Rejecting ‘modern medicine’, practitioners strive to ‘return’ to pre-colonial ecological lifeways through ‘nonviolent’, local health practices. Inspired by volunteer work with the India-based Friends of Tibet organization, Tori’s research is underpinned by a broader commitment to bridging dialogues between academic and public spheres, and looks forward to continuing doing so as part of the AES intern team.
