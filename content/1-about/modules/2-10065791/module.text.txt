Today the AES, a section of the American Anthropological Association (AAA), is a thriving group of over 1,000 anthropologists who organize an annual meeting, publish the journal American Ethnologist, and produce engaging web content to promote scholarship and bring anthropology to a wider audience.

The emblem of the American Ethnological Society (left) is taken from the design of a silver medallion that was previously presented to winners of the AESâ€™s Elsie Clews Parson prize, awarded annually for student papers. The medallions had been made by Emory Sekaquaptewa of Hopi Crafts, Arizona, utilizing a spider symbol common to Hopi pottery design.
