####Invited Sessions
AES is sponsoring eight Invited Sessions at the AAA meeting in partnership with other AAA sections, and one workshop. The Invited Sessions show a range of ways anthropological theory can advance our understanding of contemporary issues. We draw your attention to the panel on the 2016 U.S. Presidential election.

#####The 2016 U.S. Presidential Election: Anthropologists Reflect on What Just Happened (cosponsored by AES and SANA)

Participants in this roundtable draw on anthropological insights to explore the dynamics, coverage, and implications of the 2016 elections. Presenters will provide opening statements, reflecting on issues such as the role of new and corporate media, race, gender, surging wealth inequality domestically and globally, deindustrialization, failed military interventions, protests, grassroots movements, pundits, and satirical activism. Audience members will have a chance to pose questions and join the conversation. Participants: Micaela di Leonardo (Northwestern U), Hugh Gusterson (George Washington U), Leith P Mullings (CUNY, Graduate Center), Janine R Wedel (George Mason U), Ken Guest (Baruch College, CUNY), and Cecilia C Van Hollen (Syracuse U).
