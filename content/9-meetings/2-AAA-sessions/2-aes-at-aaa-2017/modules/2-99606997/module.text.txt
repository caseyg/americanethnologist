**How's the Trumpocene Going? Anthropologists Reflect on the Past Year **
**Sponsored by:** Association for Feminist Anthropology; American Ethnological Society

Saturday, December 2, 10:15 AM - 12:00 PM
Marriott Ballroom Salon 3

In this roundtable discussion, anthropologists will comment and reflect upon life in the Trumpocene era. Among the questions that will be posed are: How has Trump's rise to power transformed global attitudes towards the US and Americans more generally? To what extent have anthropologists neglected to conduct ethnographic research in the Rust Belt and rural America, where President Trump received strong support from voters? In what ways will recent movements like Black Lives Matter and the Occupy movement be affected by a self-described "law and order" president? How might federal funding for anthropological research be affected by new budgetary priorities designed to strengthen the military, rather than the sciences and humanities? To what extent is Trump's rise to power indicative of broader global political trends? How are people mobilizing themselves to oppose a series of dramatically new initiatives that threaten to dismantle structures and policies designed to protect some of the most vulnerable members of US society? And finally, what roles should anthropologists play in a democratic society whose top elected official has demonstrated authoritarian, misogynistic, and xenophobic tendencies? 

**Participants:** William O. Beeman, Gustavo Lins Ribeiro, Adrienne Pine, Christine J. Walley, Laura Nader, Jose N. Vasquez, Bianca C. Williams, Roberto Gonzalez, Narges Bajoghli.
