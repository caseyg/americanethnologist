Much of David Harvey's work of late has updated Marx’s assumptions and analyses to address the technological, economic, and industrial changes of recent decades, explained why the economic engine of capitalism works the way it does, and explored why it stutters and stalls routinely. In this roundtable, Harvey will present his latest ideas about anti-capitalist thought and action. His presentation will describe the internal contradictions within the flow of capital that have precipitated recent crises, including the stress on endless compound growth, the necessity to exploit nature to its limits, and the tendency toward universal alienation. Harvey will explain why this economic engine should be replaced, and with what. Following his presentation will be comments by the four discussants.
