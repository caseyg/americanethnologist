**Teaching Anthropology **

Friday, Nov. 16, 8:00 AM - 10:00 AM 
Led by Kenneth Guest, Baruch College, City University of New York and Danielle Good, University of Texas, Austin. Organizer: Katherine McCaffrey.

Undergraduate students enrolled in introductory cultural anthropology courses, both majors and non-majors, comprise our disciplineâ€™s largest public audience. More than a blog post, an op-ed or a citation in a major media piece, the introductory classroom provides anthropologists with opportunities for in-depth and extended presentation of the key research strategies and analytical frameworks of our field. This teaching workshop will explore effective strategies for engaging undergraduates.

**Publishing a Peer Reviewed Article **

Friday, Nov. 16, 10:30 AM - 12:30 PM 
Led by Niko Besnier, University of Amsterdam. Organizer: Katherine McCaffrey.

This workshop is focused on helping attendees who seek to publish their manuscripts in peer-reviewed academic journals, particularly anthropology journals. The workshop will be coordinated by the editor-in-chief of American Ethnologist, who during his tenure has reviewed hundreds of manuscripts on a wide range of topics. Topics to be covered include: choosing an appropriate journal for your manuscript; understanding the importance of submission guidelines; demystifying the process of peer review; tips for responding to reviewers' comments and revising your manuscript; what to do if your manuscript is rejected outright; and tips for promoting your work once it is in print.

**Getting your Book Manuscript Published: Meet with Academic Press Editors**

Friday, Nov. 16, 1:00 PM- 3:00 PM
Led by Kate Marshall, University of California Press; Casey Kittrell, University of Texas Press; and Ken Wissoker, Duke University Press. Organizer: Katherine McCaffrey.

This workshop is focused on helping attendees who are interested in the possibility of submitting book manuscripts to peer-reviewed academic publishers. Workshop participants will include acquisitions editors from three university presses who have overseen the review of hundreds of manuscripts covering a wide range of topics. Some of the topics that will be covered include: choosing the right publisher for your work; preparing a book proposal or prospectus; submitting your book manuscript; how the peer review process works; revising your manuscript; working with publishers to promote your book; and tips for avoiding common mistakes.
