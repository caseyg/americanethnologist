###Late breaking session
**Climate Denialism, Global Warming and Environmental Catastrophe in the Trumpocene Era**
**Sponsored by:** American Ethnological Society

Saturday, December 2, 2017: 2:00 PM â€“ 3:45 PM 
Marriott Ballroom Salon 1

The year 2017 may go down in history as a turning point in the politics--and the reality--of climate change. The year began with the inauguration of Donald Trump, who for years had denied the existence of climate change. After appointing Scott Pruitt as director of the Environmental Protection Agency (an entity that he had sued over a dozen times over clean water and air laws), Trump withdrew the US from the Paris climate accord in June. In the meantime, a series of deadly and disturbing weather events have occurred in the US and other countries over the past year: Hurricane Harvey, which inundated eastern and southeastern Texas with torrential rains and unprecedented flooding; wildfires raging across Oregon, British Columbia, and other parts of the Pacific northwest; historically low Arctic and Antarctic sea ice levels; mass coral bleaching on Australia's Great Barrier Reef; monsoon floods across South Asia that inundated one-third of Bangladesh and killed more than 1200 people; and the devastation of Hurricane Irma, which at one point had the highest winds ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean. This roundtable session will explore the following questions: How can an integrative anthropological approach informed by a knowledge of social and environmental interactions lead to a more holistic understanding of climate change? In what ways might ethnographic approaches help to communicate the lived experiences of those affected by extreme climate events at the local level? How can our discipline's long-term perspective contribute to a better understanding of global warming and its relationship to human technological and social development? What can anthropological knowledge about human adaptation and survival contribute to contemporary discussions about climate change? How have political and economic structures affected popular understandings of climate change? And finally, how might social scientists effectively confront the Trump administration's general assault on science?
