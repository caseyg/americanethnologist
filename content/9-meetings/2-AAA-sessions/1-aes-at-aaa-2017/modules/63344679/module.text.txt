###AES/AAA Invited and Volunteered Sessions for AAA 2017

March 6, 2017

Dear AES Colleagues,

We are well into the new year, and it’s time to start thinking about your submission to the 116th AAA Annual Meetings, which take place November 29 to December 3, 2017 at the Marriott Wardman Park Hotel in Washington, DC. This year Tristan Jones (AES graduate student rep) and I will serve as Program Reviewers. This message includes deadline information and instructions for submitting panels, papers, and posters. The American Ethnological Society welcomes your submissions and we look forward to reconnecting in DC. 

####Theme
"Anthropology Matters!," the theme of the 2017 conference, is a call to "gather in opposition to strict boundaries, spill across academic divides and blur the synthetic lines that isolate good questions from generously intellectual and fearlessly anthropological investigation." AES offers programming that provides a clearer and critical understanding of the current moment. It is in this spirit that we invite your proposals. We especially encourage proposals that contain explicit crossover with other AAA sections. 

####Registration
Conference registration is now open. Please submit proposals via the [Online Submission Portal](http://www.americananthro.org/AttendEvents/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=1697&navItemNumber=695&navItemNumber=21274) (new for 2017). As always, planning early is critical. Organized sessions almost always fare better than individual papers (which then must be organized into sessions after submission). Also, sessions that represent potential collaborations and co-sponsorship with other AAA sections expand AES's programming capacity. Poster submissions are also welcome. 

####Proposals
<span style="color: red">The deadline to submit proposals (including invited sessions), papers, and posters is Friday, April 14 at 5 PM EDT.</span> (Note the earlier deadline from previous years.) 

####Dates/Deadlines
**02/17:** Online Submission Portal opens. 
**04/14:** Proposals for all sessions, papers, and posters due @ 5 PM EDT. 
**04/14:** Conference Registration Deadline @5 PM EDT. 
**07/10 (week of):** Accept/decline notifications sent via email. 
**11/29 to 12/3:** 116th AAA Annual Meetings

####Reminders
**Participation and Exemptions:** Participation is limited to current paid AAA members. Visiting scholars from other disciplines or for anthropologists from countries other than the United States or Canada are eligible to obtain an exemption from the membership requirement. Individuals with membership exemptions are nonmembers and pay a higher registration fee.
**Meeting Refunds:** Registration fees are refunded to presenters whose proposals/abstracts have not been accepted for the annual meeting program. The request must be made by the presenter. Registration fees will not be refunded to program presenters who withdraw or cancel on their own accord.

Sincerely,
Roberto González
AES Councillor and 2017 Program Editor
