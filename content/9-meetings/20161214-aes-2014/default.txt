The visible and the unseen are states of growing anthropological engagement. The conference theme looks to visibilization and concealment, and their ambiguous thresholds, as prompts to new questions in the domains of politics, the economy, religion, media, social inequality, citizenship, security, human rights and humanitarianism. Those emergent questions insist that visibility and invisibility are active processes, not merely empirical states or static qualities of appearance or non-appearance. As such, the theme of this conference draws on a thread that ties creative sociocultural engagements in anthropology to older questions of method, meaning and representation. At issue are current public controversies about “dark sites” in politics, national security, and law; shadow, alien and regulated forms within commerce, finance, and the environment; techniques of legibility, surveillance and their evasion; visual media’s growing influence; and the hopes and fears pinned on emerging biomedical, computational and manufacturing technologies. Concern with processes of in/visibilization is more than ever pertinent to anthropological representation itself, as anthropologists increasingly adopt visual media even as scholars of the cultural politics of representation and visual anthropology, ethnographic filmmakers and students of indigenous media debate the politics, ethics and methods of the image.

Proposals for sessions (panels, roundtables, other formats) that make creative use of the allotted time (1 hour 45 minutes) are encouraged, including (but not limited to) panels that explore a key text, media, or visual project circulated to conference participants in advance and panels that feature excerpts of audio/visual works or make a visual and/or textual response to a specific concept or keyword relating to the conference themes. Proposals for individual papers are also invited.

**Abstract submission deadline 24 January 2014**.

The conference registration receipt, sent to each conference registrant by email, will have a link to the paper abstract and panel proposal submission portal.

The pre-conference workshop, on “collaborative ethnography,” is now fully subscribed but seats are still available for the “text/image/ethics” workshop, led by Jonathan Marion (Thursday, 10 April, 1-2:45PM). The **text/image/ethics workshop** will explore how to synergistically harness image- and text-based content to maximize their evocative and explicative potentials. At the same time, image-specific ethical issues will be considered, insufficiently accounted for in text-based ethical guidelines. Participants will gain concrete ideas about working with texts and images, and a framework for considering visual ethics.
