<h2><u>Borders/Bridges</u></h2>
<br>
In the current historical moment, many countries are experiencing resurgent racism, nativism, and authoritarian politics. As global economic instability and demographic changes transform entire nation-states, demagogues are testing the limits of political and legal systems, inflaming followers by scapegoating ethnic and religious minorities, immigrants, and refugees for social problems. In the United States, these trends take a variety of shapes, including efforts to politically polarize the citizenry, rising white nationalism, draconian immigration policies, attempts to restrict the movement of those seeking asylum, and proposals to extend a separation wall across the entire US-Mexico border. Such phenomena are reminiscent of the early 20th century, when prospective immigrants from East Asia and Eastern Europe were practically excluded from the United States. Despite these developments, many groups and individuals are attempting to heal the wounds of xenophobia and fear by building bridges of empathy, compassion, and cross-cultural understanding. They are also crafting new legal responses, engaging in political activism, and creatively reimagining citizenship in these challenging contexts.

How should anthropologists respond, at a time when so many political figures around the world prefer to build barriers rather than bridges, to sow hostility rather than humanity? For our Spring 2020 meeting, we invite anthropologists and other scholars and activists to join the American Ethnological Society (AES) and the Association for Political and Legal Anthropology (APLA) to consider the cultural, historical, legal and political implications of these troubling transformations. In a national election year, Austin--the capital city of a border state undergoing tectonic political shifts--is a particularly appropriate site to reflect upon and challenge these global trends.

This conference is co-sponsored by the University of Texas at Austin's Department of Anthropology and College of Liberal Arts. It will take place at the Thompson Conference Center, on the UT Austin campus.
