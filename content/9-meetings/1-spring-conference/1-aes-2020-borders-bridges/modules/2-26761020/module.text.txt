Graduate and undergraduate students, we have a deal for you! AES membership is free if you sign up between now and March 26, 2020. This would normally be $12, but itâ€™s free for a whole year. It also will also get you a $5 discount on the APLA spring meeting registration because you can register for at student "member" rate ($40) rather than the student "non-member" rate ($45). To do this, (link: https://secure.americananthro.org/eweb/DynamicPage.aspx?Site=AAAWeb&WebKey=ced2aab5-ccd7-4f28-bd95-01edee542f5e&navItemNumber=636 text: register at the AAA's portal), then become an AES member by either joining or renewing your membership. Enter the code <strong>"AES2020"</strong> at the checkout on the join/renew form.
