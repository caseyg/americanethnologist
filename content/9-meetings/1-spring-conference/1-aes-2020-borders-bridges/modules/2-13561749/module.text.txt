**"#AnthroTwitter--How to Use Social Media and Other Platforms to Get Your Ideas Out (and Change the World)"**
How can Twitter, Facebook, and other social media platforms be used to share anthropological knowledge, communicate ethnographic insights, provoke political action, and promote social change? This workshop, moderated by Chelsey Carter (Washington U-St. Louis) will give you the chance to join a dynamic group of anthropologists who have used social media to push the boundaries of anthropology far beyond the academy.
