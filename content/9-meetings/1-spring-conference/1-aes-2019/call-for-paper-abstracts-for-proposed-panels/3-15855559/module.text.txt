##Latin American Transnational Feminisms: Apuntes desde la academia en sororidad

**Organizers/Contact: Natalia Guzmán Solano**, <guzmansolano.natalia@wustl.edu> (Washington University in St. Louis) and **Francesca Dennstedt** (Washington University in St. Louis)

Throughout the Americas we are living through a moment driven by queer and women’s joint resistance to right-wing fundamentalist politics and oppression attempting a return to a status quo that has only been possible on the backs of subjugated gendered and racialized populations. #NiUnaMenos, #EleNão, #MeToo, las pañoletas verdes, among other movements, are examples of the demand to be seen, heard, and reckoned with. In these instances of mobilized resistance we understand how, alongside our differences, we share the communal pain of gendered violence. Nos están matando rings with a particularly urgent and personal force because to enunciate “feminicide” (Sanford 2008; Segato 2013), as well as homo- and transphobic hate killings, is to interrupt the patriarchal logics that undergird the “necropolitics” of alleged democratic nation-states (Mbembe 2003). This panel seeks to expand our frames of reference by considering what solidarity with our compañerxs means across the multi-layered professions, fields, and social positions each one holds. We take seriously what commitment looks like from within the academy as one form of localized activism. Specifically, we ask: how are we through our commitments expanding the language of feminism toward communal practices cemented by sorority?
