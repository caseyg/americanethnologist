##Troubling Whiteness: Complicity, Fragility, and Ethics

**Organizer/Contact: Jong Bum Kwon**, <jongkwon00@webster.edu> (Webster University)

Whiteness has become an object of both unapologetic mobilizing and visible public concern. From the killing of Mike Brown (one of many dead black and brown bodies) and acquittal of Darren Wilson to the election of Donald Trump and the Charlottesville “Unite the Right Rally,” the surge in nativism, the opioid crisis (a war on drugs that wasn’t), “whiteness” has come to index for many the disquiet as well as the vulnerable of these times. “Whiteness”, however, is slippery. Whiteness is often characterized as a structural position of social advantage and power reproduced in part by misrecognition by its beneficiaries. It is said to be unmarked, invisible, the norm. As an object of critique, it often remains abstract as “system” or “institution,” and it is susceptible to conflation with white “race” (or ethnicity) or “culture”. This panel seeks to complicate whiteness and open discussion to various conceptualizations, methodologies, ethnographic analyses.
