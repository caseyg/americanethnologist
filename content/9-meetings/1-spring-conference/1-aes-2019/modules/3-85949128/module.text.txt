Graduate (and undergraduate) students! We have a deal for you. AES membership is free if you sign up between now and March 17, 2019. This would normally be $12, but it’s free for a whole year. It also will get you a $5 discount on the AES/ALLA/ABA spring meeting registration because you can register for at student “member" rate ($40) rather than the student "non-member" rate ($45). To access this deal, do the following: 
- Become an AES member. Enter the code AES19 at the checkout on the join/renew form. 
- Then register for the AES/ALLA/ABA 2019 spring conference (link: https://www.conferenceabstracts.com/cfp2/loginsso.asp?EventKey=KZUAAVCQ&UserEmail=&UserPassword=&User=&memberID= text: HERE) at the subsidized student member rate.
