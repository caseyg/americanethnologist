####Rasanblaj Ethnography
**Friday, March 15 | 10:00-11:45 a.m.
Gina Athena Ulysse (Wesleyan University)**

Using the notion of rasanblaj (assembly, compilation, enlisting, regrouping (of ideas, things, people, spirits. For example, fè yon rasanblaj, do a gathering, a ceremony, a protest) as theory, method and praxis, this workshop is aimed at recognizing, naming, and exploring the imperatives at play in the making of aesthetically rich ethnography without fetishizing the arts.

####Creative Ethnography – Comics and Fictional Forms
**Friday, March 15 | 1:00-2:45 p.m.
Sherine F. Hamdy (University of California at Irvine)**

This workshop will explore creative expressions of ethnography, with an eye on comics, poetry, plays, performances, short stories, and novels that draw on ethnographic research. In what ways does expanding the genres and formats of ethnographic research create more inclusive spaces of participation? What might be some of the pitfalls? Participants will be encouraged to develop some ideas they may have on expanding particular projects.

####Intimate Ethnography
**Friday, March 15 | 3:00-4:45 p.m.
Alisse Waterston (John Jay College)**

Intimate ethnography comes when the need to engage larger publics in rethinking and recounting lives lived and experienced is increasingly urgent. The approach situates an intimate Other—not the self and not a stranger, but someone with whom the ethnographer is in close, personal relation—at the center of an anthropological research and writing project. The workshop will introduce participants to intimate ethnography as (1) an approach to research in anthropology, (2) a form of nonfiction writing, and (3) an approach to dialogue.
