) AES is running its upcoming spring conference -- titled, “Exposure”-- at Stanford University, from Thursday, March 30 to Saturday, April 1, 2017. Registrationis now open!All applicants should register at AAA websiteBEFORE submission. For detailedinstructions, see below.(link: http://projects.americananthro.org/papers/aes/ text: Submit)proposals for workshops, special events, panels, and individual papers by January 20, 2016. See below for the conference's excellent discounted housing options. *Call for Papers:*People seek out exposure at one moment and run from it the next. As a source of hope, exposure promises forward movement, growth, benefit, the idea that something better will come from positive attention. A contract, a job, a resolution. However, as a linchpin of vulnerability, exposure is a daunting beast, one which can trigger episodes of violence, racism, incarceration, shame, ruin, disease, and the like. Internet revelations that won’t go away. The outing of sexual orientation. Discovery of visa violations. There are dealmakers who profit off such painful forms of exposure, and there are professionals who make a livelihood managing them—politically, scientifically, ethically. The American Ethnological Society takes up exposure at its 2017 annual spring conference. Welcoming anthropology and other scholarly disciplines, this conference encourages presentations that treat exposure as a ground for making sense of urgent issues in the world today, presentations that tackle exposure as either topic or method. Exposure has long been part of many a knowledge maker's toolbox, and it is certainly indispensable today for whistleblowers, community activists, and investigative journalists who use exposure for their progressive projects of speaking truth to power. Over the years, no less now in the era of WikiLeaks, anthropologists have strived to mobilize methods of exposure for human enhancement, to illuminate otherwise unseen forces of domination with the hope of fostering new political potentials. AES’s 2017 conference asks, in different sociocultural contexts, how is exposure currently undergoing transformation, how is its normalization shifting with rapid changes in technology, how is exposure morphing in relationship to affective economies, how have anthropologists historically handled exposure, and what new work must be done in and outside of the academy in order to better understand as well as influence the shifting authority of this keyword in people’s lives? AES17 will celebrate formats of exposition—tried or untested—holding out promise to conjure, visualize, and broadcast new reflections on exposure, its histories, processes, discourses, sentiments, and transformational effects. ### **(Tentative) Schedule for Thursday, March 30**
