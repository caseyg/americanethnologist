## How to Register
####Interested in attending AES17?  Please join us!  You don’t have to be delivering a paper to attend our many panels, workshops, and plenaries.  You’ll need to register, though.  Here’s how:

1. Follow the link below to the American Anthropological Association’s Section Meeting Registration webpage: https://secure.americananthro.org/eweb/DynamicPage.aspx?Site=AAAWeb&WebKey=ced2aab5-ccd7-4f28-bd95-01edee542f5e 
2. Find the listing for the “American Ethnological Society (AES) 2017 Spring Conference” and click on“Register.”
3. You will be asked to either create an account or login with your existing AAA account to register. You do not need to become a member of the AAA or the AES to register for the conference.
4. Confirm the registrant and badge information, and select our meeting next when asked to select the meeting (question #3).
5. Select the registration type and any special events, such as the Saturday Banquet.
6. Click “add to cart” at the bottom right and proceed to payment.
7. You will receive two receipt emails from the AAA, not from us. The link to the submission portal is on the second email. Please be sure to check any spam or “clutter” folder on your email client for the email from the AAA. 
8. If you have any difficulties in creating or logging into your existing AAA account or in registering for the conference, please contact the AAA directly (aaameetings@americananthro.org) for assistance.

Questions? Contact conference organizer and AES Councilor Matthew Kohrman at aesconf2017[at]gmail[dot]com.
