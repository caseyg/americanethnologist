------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The American Ethnological Society hosts an annual spring conference, typically co-organized with another sub-section (e.g. CASCA, SANA, etc.). The conference organizers jointly develop a broad and pertinent theme in order to inspire and organize panel and individual paper submissions. AES encourages experimentation with different kinds of presentation styles beyond the “polished paper” approach. The AES spring conference invites participants to develop alternative presentations -- such as informal discussions, extemporaneous talks, point/counterpoint sessions, and workshops – in order to encourage discussion over performance. Announcements regarding the AES spring conference will be posted on this website, as well as distributed at the annual AAA meeting, and published in the “(link: http://aesonline.org/publications/aes-section-news-in-anthropology-news/ text: **AES Section News**)" of *Anthropology News*.
