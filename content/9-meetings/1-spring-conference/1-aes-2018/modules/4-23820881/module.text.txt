**Frankenstein in Baghdad
Friday, March 23, 10-11:45 am**
Zainab Saleh will lead a discussion of Frankenstein in Baghdad by Ahmed Saadawi (Penguin Books, 2018), in part to reflect on 15 years since the US invaded Iraq. In this allegorical version of the Frankenstein story, the monster is made of the body parts of war victims, and seeks vengeance.   This book won the International Prize for Arabic Fiction and France’s Grand Prize for Fantasy.  https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/22/books/review-frankenstein-in-baghdad-ahmed-saadawi.html

**The Wild Robot
Saturday, March 24, 10-11:45 am**
Susan Falls and Jeff Maskovsky will lead a discussion of The Wild Robot by Peter Brown (Little, Brown Books, 2016). This book — written for 8 to 11 year olds — asks the question, “Can a robot survive the wilderness?”  When robot Roz opens her eyes for the first time, she discovers that she is alone on a remote, wild island. She has no idea how she got there or what her purpose is--but she knows she needs to survive. After battling a fierce storm and escaping a vicious bear attack, she realizes that her only hope for survival is to adapt to her surroundings and learn from the island's unwelcoming animal inhabitants. This book begs all kinds of questions about family, belonging, consciousness, nature, and ecology.  Read it and look at the pretty pictures and come to talk us about it.

**Garments
Saturday, March 24, 3-4:45 pm**
Dina Siddiqi and Caitrin Lynch will lead a discussion of the 2015 award-winning short story “Garments,” by Tahmima Anam.  The story focuses on a woman who works in a Bangladeshi garment factory, and is set in the context of the 2013 collapse of the Rana Plaza factory that killed 1,100 garment workers in Dhaka. Come for a discussion of labor, the global apparel industry, and the relationship between the craft of fiction writing and the craft of ethnographic writing. (We’ll provide a pdf copy of the story to those who sign up.) https://www.londonreviewbookshop.co.uk/blog/2016/9/garments-by-tahmima-anam
