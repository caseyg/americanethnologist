## Helpful Tips for Preparing your Proposals

**Possible Panel Formats**

AES welcomes experimental formats of exposition.  Though, in order to facilitate scheduling of rooms, the program committee will prefer panel submissions that fall into increments of 1 hour and 45 minutes.  Double panels are possible.  No need to organize panels with an intention that each presenter has an allocation of exactly 15 minutes.  More time, less time per participant would be fine.  For those organizing a panel along conventional lines, the delivery of at least three papers is encouraged; more of course is welcomed.  The presence of formal discussant/s on your panel is not required, but certainly encouraged.

**Help Finding People for Your Panel**

If you are short one or two people for your panel proposal, AES can help you circulate a CFP via our media channels (e.g., Facebook page, listserv) to recruit participants.  Please contact us well before the Jan 20th deadline at aesconf2017[at]gmail[dot]com.

**Individual Paper Proposal**

If you don’t have anyone else recruited for a panel but have a strong idea in mind, consider submitting a proposal for an individual paper.  Accepted individual proposals will be grouped into panels by the AES program committee.

**Pre-circulation of Papers**

If you’d like us to pre-circulate papers, please let us know at least one month before the conference, and we’ll upload your paper/s to a conference cloud folder and provide links to that folder in the conference program.

**Roundtables and Abstracts**

Reminder: the AAA registration system does not require each individual participating in a roundtable to submit an abstract
