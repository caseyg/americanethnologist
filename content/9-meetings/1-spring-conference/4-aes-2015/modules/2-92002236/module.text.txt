**4) Integrating Visual and Psychological Anthropology: A Workshop with Robert Lemelson**

In this interactive workshop, participants will explore visual anthropology methods with ethnographic filmmaker Robert Lemelson. Lemelson, the president of the Foundation for Psychocultural Research and research anthropologist at the Semel Institute of Neuroscience at UCLA, has made nine ethnographic documentaries. The New York Times called his latest film, Bitter Honey, “an agonizing documentary examination of polygamy in Bali, Indonesia.” Participants will discuss filmmaking technique and anthropological concepts while working hands on with new film technologies.
Registration cost: Free
