##Methods on Digital Ethnographies: Queer of Color Imaginations of Pleasure & Practice

The multimodality of digital media necessitates the reframing of the methodological practices that comb at the intimacies of meaning in digital fieldwork/sites, the ethnographer, space/time, and collaborative place-making. As ethnographers of digital spaces, the framing of the self encapsulated through text and images shapes the saliency of digital narratives/lives. Digital spaces are often interpreted as public spaces thus always framed in whiteness. How do we negotiate our private selves doing “public” work? We center queer/of color differences in researcher profiles, group representation, and ethnographic interaction as we navigate the messiness. Thus, work on digital spaces requires minoritarian perspectives and critiques that make ethical engagements toward scales of engagements throughout the process of research formulation.
