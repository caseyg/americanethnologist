##Locating Urban Futures: Ethnographic Engagements with Cities & Environments In-the-Making

**Organizers/Contact: Megan Maurer**, <meg.maurer@gmail.com> (The Earth Institute, Columbia University) and **Kristin Monroe** (University of Kentucky)

Around the world, the future of urban environments is growing increasingly uncertain. The effects of growing city size and urban population, as well as climate change impacts like extreme weather and sea-level rise, exert pressures on urban environments, ecologies, and infrastructures. Meanwhile, political instability and violent conflict result in the destruction of urban environments, and rising rates of social inequality fuel contestations over policy priorities and resource access and distribution. In these and so many more ways, the urban seems headed toward crisis. In response to the deep anxieties of the current socio-ecological moment, however, cities continue to be sites of possibility, as everyone from politicians to technocrats, oligarchs to activists to everyday city-dwellers create —alongside myriad nonhuman inhabitants and constituents—new urban futures. What do these futures look like? How are urban environments being newly imagined, engaged and challenged? In this panel we seek to bring together urban researchers working at the nexus of environments and futures and invite scholars to develop a discussion of ethnography in and of cities as a tool for understanding our current socio-ecological moment.
