###Opening Plenary
**Decolonizing American Anthropology: Ethnographic Futures & Possibilities
Thursday, March 14, 2019**

**4:30-5:30 p.m.** Opening Meet & Greet and Welcome by Chancellor-Elect Andrew D. Martin and Section Presidents
**5:30-7:00 p.m.** Plenary followed by reception

Ethnography, as a methodological and literary technique, uniquely connects the global and the local. The blending of theory with the everyday allows us to speak to issues of global significance, critically linking global trends and big data to local lifeways and contestations. Yet, anthropologists are largely absent from public debates. Given that our methodological positioning allows us to often predict the absurd, such as the current political moment, this feels particularly disturbing. At the same time, this insularity is partially of the discipline’s own making. Internal debates within the discipline reveal the unsettled hauntings of anthropology's racialized, gendered, colonial, and generally hierarchical past. In the Ethnographic Futures & Possibilities opening plenary session, critically engaged ethnographers challenge our traditional disciplinary techniques and offer unapologetically disruptive ways for making anthropology relevant to both the communities with whom we study and the general public, while critically interrogating our own internal hierarchies.

###Plenary: Three-Part Series
**Troubling Ferguson & Beyond: Emergent Futures in the Afterlife of Racialized Death and Defiance in Divided Times and Spaces**

“Troubling Ferguson & Beyond” is a three-part plenary series that considers emergent socio-political forms in the contemporary moment of racialized and gendered violences. Using as its springboard the 5th year anniversary of the Ferguson protests around the acquittal of the police officer who killed unarmed black young man Michael Brown and the birth of Black Lives Matter, this plenary series brings together practitioners, activists, and academic scholars. Each plenary “troubles” a different analytic as it considers the (re)production of anti-black and -brown state violences, various contestations, and possible futures in this troubled moment in divided cities.
