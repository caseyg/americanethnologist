Title: Guidelines for Book Reviewers

----

Text: 

AE’s book review editor invites scholars to review books. The journal does not accept unsolicited or volunteered book reviews.

Book review manuscripts should be a maximum of 1,000 words, in 12-point font, double-spaced, with one-inch margin on all sides. Reviews should not require notes, and usually no citations. If you do cite the work of others in the review, cite no more than two sources, and use the same format as for articles in the journal. Number every page. Save the manuscript as a Word document.

Starting with the February 2016 issue (43:1), AE uses The Chicago Manual of Style, 16th edition, rather than the 2009 AAA Style Guide. For spelling, the reference is Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary, 11th edition, which uses US (rather than British) spellings; wherever Merriam-Webster’s offers a choice in spelling, use the first choice provided.

Please send the book review manuscript as an attachment to aebookreviews@gmail.com. Please include publication data for the book at the top of the first page, using punctuation as follows: Title of the Book. Author’s Name. Place of publication: Publisher, date of publication. # of pages.

Reviewer’s name and affiliation data should follow on the next line, as in this example:

> Gifts: A Study in Comparative Law. Richard Hyland. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009. 708 pp.
> 
> JANE I. GUYER
> 
> Johns Hopkins University

In general the most useful reviews address an audience that includes anthropologists who are not area experts and provide a sketch of the strengths of the book. The editor reserves the right to request revisions, copyedit, and proofread all articles accepted for publication.
