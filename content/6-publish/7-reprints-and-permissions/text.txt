Title: Reprints and Permissions

----

Text: 

Authors have standing permission to reproduce free of charge their past contributions to AAA publications in new books they are writing or editing. This provision is included in the contract signed by an author when he or she contributes to an AAA publication.

If you are an author/represent a publishing company who/which would like to include content originally published in an AAA book by another author in a reader, anthology, second serial, digest, syndication or non-book (dramatization, motion picture [sight and sound], radio, television or electronic recording), send a formal request to permissions at aaanet.org.  Please include the following information:

a) An exact citation (name of the article, author, volume and issue of the journal or book in which it appeared, page numbers).

b) Your contact information, including your address and fax number (if possible).

c) Publisher and publication in which the article is to appear, along with expected publication date.

Authors/publishing companies who/which submit permission requests will receive a contract that outlines the fee for the article, conditions of use and contact information for the author. Requesters will be responsible for contacting authors and obtaining their permission to reprint the article.

Requests to reprint photographs or other images from AAA publications should be directed to permissions at aaanet.org for a price quote.
