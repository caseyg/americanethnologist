Title: Timely Review and Publication

----

Text: AE is mindful of the importance of timely review and publication. In recent years, nearly all articles have been published within one year of their submission dates. In addition, most have been published within six months of their acceptance dates. Since 2011, the average time from manuscript submission to editorial decision has been three to four months. (Delays can occur when reviews arrive late, but in such cases time lost can almost always be made up in an accelerated publication timeline.)
