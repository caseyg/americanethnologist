Title: Intro

----

Text: *On the occasion of the publication of Columbia University anthropologist Lila Abu-Lughod’s article, “The cross-publics of ethnography: the case of the Muslim woman,” in the November 2016 issue of the journal, we have invited Norwegian anthropologist Sindre Bangstad to interview Abu-Lughod on fundamental issues underlying her work as a feminist anthropologist, a public intellectual, and an ethnographer of the Middle East and Islamophobia. This year also marks the 30th anniversary of the publication of Abu-Lughod’s landmark ethnography *Veiled Sentiments*, which has inspired an entire generation of scholars and students to rethink their understanding of gender, power, and poetics. I thank Lila and Sindre for sharing their conversation with the readership of the journal.* —*Niko Besnier, editor*
