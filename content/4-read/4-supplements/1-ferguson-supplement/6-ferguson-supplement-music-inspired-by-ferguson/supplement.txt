# #Ferguson Supplement: Music Inspired by Ferguson

Musicians both locally and nationally responded to the killing of Michael Brown, whether through songs written immediately after the shooting, reworkings of earlier material to fit the social needs of the moment, or new projects reasserting the value of musical expression as an informal memory practice for marginalized communities. Hip-hop artists especially serve as what Ronnie Notch calls "street reporters."
