Caption: An untitled painting by Kinshasa artist Bosoku Ekunde, 2014. The painting depicts documentaires, or those who beg using documents in Kinshasa. While the artist made the painting at the author's request, he chose to depict the international population from which beggars request donations. From left to right, he shows documentaires begging from people of West African, Asian, and Congolese origin; both beggars and donors point at documents. In the foreground, he depicts individual beggars.
