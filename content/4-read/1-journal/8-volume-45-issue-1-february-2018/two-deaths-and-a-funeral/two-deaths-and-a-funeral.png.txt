Caption: Mourners stand at an altar inside the home of the newly deceased Lê Hiếu Long in Đà Nẵng, Việt Nam, July 15, 2007. The black-and-white banner hanging atop the house's entrance announces, in romanized Vietnamese (quốc ngữ) script, a “Condolences Ritual and Memorial Ceremony” for “Comrade” (real name obscured to protect anonymity). The red-and-yellow altar banner embroidered in a Sino-romanized script—together with flower wreaths that, like the outdoor banner, bear printed quốc ngữ inscriptions—emphasizes the high status of the deceased and his family, as well as their relations as virtuous citizens and loving kin.
