Text: Among Finland's public-service broadcasters, there is a contrast between professional ethics and the “fearless speech” of *parrhêsia*. This contrast reveals some of the diverse forms in which free speech is pursued in contemporary liberal polities. In 2015, *Kansanradio* (The people's radio), a popular Finnish radio show, became a site for fresh controversies over free speech when the so-called migrant crisis dominated its discussions. Caught between the *parrhêsia* of public intellectuals and bigoted listeners, *Kansanradio’s* hosts pursued a dialogical approach to truth telling. Whereas *parrhêsia* risks the relationship between interlocutors, this dialogical modality rests on a carefully cultivated multivocality of viewpoints. It challenges the assumption—common to both the scholarship on *parrhêsia* and some (but not all) liberal orientations—that voice is a person's private property.
