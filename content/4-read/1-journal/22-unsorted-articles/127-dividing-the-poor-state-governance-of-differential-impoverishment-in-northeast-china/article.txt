By Mun Young Cho How is poverty being managed in China when pauperization of some has become an unavoidable condition of the market economy and when the poor, nevertheless, attempt to make legitimate claims that cannot be overlooked by the developmental and officially socialist state? In this article, I examine “dividing the poor” as a project of governing urban laid-off workers and rural migrants in postreform China. This project has been made possible through a porous array of governmental intersections that include the temporality of state policies, disjunctive layers of state actions, and the positionality of state agents.
