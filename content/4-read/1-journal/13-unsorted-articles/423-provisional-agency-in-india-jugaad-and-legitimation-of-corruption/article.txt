Photo by Beatrice Jauregui.People in India deploy a variety of euphemisms for corruption, one of which is *jugaad*, which refers to goal-oriented improvisation, especially the use of informal social networks to advance one’s interests. But as often as it is conflated with corruption, *jugaad* is also conceived as necessary for “getting by” and even as virtuous practice. This ethnography of police practices in Uttar Pradesh shows how the contronymic character of *jugaad* emerges from widespread valuation of what I call “provisional agency,” which is both a capability to provide a social good and a temporary means of mobility geared toward a better future. Understanding practices that may be deemed “corrupt” as embodiments of provisional agency breaks down a clear distinction between virtue and vice and works to disaggregate a rigid inverse relationship between morality and power that assumes “elite” dominance can only be answered by resistance or acquiescence “from below.”
