**Lucas Bessire** and **David Bond**, August 2014, "Ontological anthropology and the deferral of critique." American Ethnologist vol. 41 (issue 3). (link: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/amet.12083/abstract text: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/amet.12083/abstract) ABSTRACT What does ontological anthropology promise, what does it presume, and how does it contribute to the formatting of life in our present? Drawing from our respective fieldwork on how Indigenous alterity is coenvisioned and how the lively materiality of hydrocarbons is recognized, we develop an ethnographic and theoretical critique of ontological anthropology. This essay, then, provides an empirical counterweight to what the ontological turn celebrates of Native worlds and what it rejects of modernity. In it, we examine the methodological and conceptual investments of ontological anthropology. The figure of the ontological as commonly invoked, we argue, often narrows the areas of legitimate concern and widens the scope of acceptable disregard within social research. We chart how this paradigm’s analytical focus on the future redefines the coordinates of the political as well as anthropology’s relation to critique. Finally, we formulate three conceptual theses that encapsulate our criticism and open this discussion to further debate. Keywords: *ontology, critique, nature–culture, alterity, materiality*•••

**Cecilia McCallum**, August 2014, "Cashinahua perspectives on functional anatomy: Ontology, ontogenesis, and biomedical education in Amazonia." American Ethnologist vol. 41 (issue 3). (link: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/amet.12091/abstract text: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/amet.12091/abstract) ABSTRACT Ontological dimensions of encounters between Brazilian biomedical Cartesianism and Amerindian perspectivism come into sharp focus in an intensive course in functional anatomy offered to trainee indigenous health agents in Acre state, Brazil. After presenting the biomedics’ rationalization of the course, which centered on the supervised dissection of a cadaver, I look at Cashinahua students’ accounts of their participation in the training and consider the broader implications of this particular engagement between two profoundly different philosophical traditions from the angle of the ontogenesis of meaning. I contextualize the students’ views of the cadaver through discussion of Cashinahua phenomenology of the body and cumulative personhood. Rather than revealing a confrontation between distinct “cultures,” as suggested by the term interculturality, analysis supports a focus on the interplay between ontology and epistemology within historically specific ontogenetic processes. Keywords: *Amerindian perspectivism, biomedical education, ontology, ontogenesis, indigenous health agents, Cashinahua, Brazilian Amazonia*•••

**Harry Walker**, May 2013, “State of play: The political ontology of sport in Amazonian Peru.” American Ethnologist vol. 40 (issue 2): 382-398. (link: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/amet.12028/abstract text: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/amet.12028/abstract) ABSTRACT Building on the importance of “play” in traditional sociality, organized team sports such as soccer are instrumental in promoting a new moral and political order among Urarina people of Peruvian Amazonia, one grounded in notions of roles, rules, and the abstract individual. As a vehicle of nationalist sentiment, highly amenable to ritualization and bureaucratization, sport is central to the process by which the state expands its territory and influence. Like warfare, but unifying rather than fragmenting in its effects, sport harnesses the energy and vitality of youth and co-opts them for other ends. Keywords: *play; soccer; state; political ontology; Amazonia*•••

**Natalie Porter**, February 2013, “Bird flu biopower: Strategies for multipspecies coexistence in Viet Nam.” American Ethnologist vol. 40 (issue 1): 132-148. (link: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/amet.12010/abstract text: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/amet.12010/abstract) ABSTRACT Outbreaks of SARS, swine flu, and avian influenza have prompted a “One Health” effort to control diseases transmitted between species. Using ethnographic observations from Việt Nam, I reveal how avian flu transforms strategies for living in light of human vulnerability to animals. Positing a multispecies approach to biopower, I argue that techniques for safeguarding human–animal collectivities confront heterogeneous moral codes surrounding animals’ role in knowledge hierarchies, village economies, and notions of individual worth. This analysis provides a framework for reconceptualizing biopower in relation to emerging diseases and reenvisions the role of animals in the politics of life itself. Keywords: *biopower; human–animal relations; avian influenza; ViệtNam; multispecies ethnography; ethics*•••

**Benjamin Smith**, May 2012, “Language and the frontiers of the human: Aymara animal-oriented interjections and the mediation of mind.” American Ethnologist vo. 39 (issue 2): 313-324. (link: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1425.2012.01366.x/abstract text: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1425.2012.01366.x/abstract) ABSTRACT In this article, I offer an analysis of Peruvian Aymara speech directed toward sheep and alpacas, children, and marbles (specifically, the use of “animal-oriented interjections”). The use of these forms positions addressees as reduced (quasi) agents and thereby mediates Aymara ideologies about the scaled or graduated character of those enminded beings that regularly act as addressees. Ultimately, the analysis reveals an Aymara human–nonhuman frontier that requires attention to both the interactional encounters sustained across perceived ontological divides (divides understood to turn on species and ethnodevelopmental difference, etc.) and the (scaled) character of the ideologies that renders these divides “ontological.” Keywords: *humans, animals, childhood, materiality, semiotics, mind, Andes*•••

** Lucas Bessire**, November 2011, “Apocalyptic futures: The violent transformation of moral human life among Ayoreo-speaking people of the Paraguayan Gran Chaco.” American Ethnologist vol. 38 (issue 4): 743-757. (link: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1425.2011.01334.x/abstract text: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1425.2011.01334.x/abstract) ABSTRACT In this article, I describe the social topography of apocalyptic futurism among recently contacted Ayoreo-speaking people in Paraguay to examine the novel senses of being in the world that are emerging in harsh postcontact conditions. I show how apocalyptic futurism exceeds the temporal confines of both “traditional culture” and “Christianity.” Rather, it derives from the afterlife of violence and a general consensus that biological survival now requires a reconstitution of the terms of humanity. Apocalyptic sensibilities are concerned with more than local values or the transcendence of death; rather, as I show, they mark a new threshold between the human and the nonhuman. Keywords: *apocalypticism; indigeneity; contact; violence; biolegitimacy; Gran Chaco; Ayoreo*•••

**Matei Candea**, May 2010, ‘“I fell in love with Carlos the meerkat”: Engagement and detachment in human-animal relations.’ American Ethnologist vol. 37 (issue 2): 241-258. (link: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1425.2010.01253.x/abstract text: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1425.2010.01253.x/abstract) ABSTRACT Relationship, connection, and engagement have emerged as key values in recent studies of human–animal relations. In this article, I call for a reexamination of the productive aspects of detachment. I trace ethnographically the management of everyday relations between biologists and the Kalahari meerkats they study, and I follow the animals’ transformation as subjects of knowledge and engagement when they become the stars of an internationally popular, televised animal soap opera. I argue that treating detachment and engagement as polar opposites is unhelpful both in this ethnographic case and, more broadly, in anthropological discussions of ethics and knowledge making. Keywords: *human–animal relations, science, media, ethics, engagement, detachment*•••

**Kevin P. Groark**, November 2009, “Discourses of the soul: The negotiation of personal agency in Tzotzil Maya dream narrative.” American Ethnologist vol. 36 (issue 4): 705-721. (link: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1425.2009.01205.x/abstract text:  http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1425.2009.01205.x/abstract) ABSTRACT In this article, I examine the framing of personal agency in Tzotzil Maya dream narrative. Drawing on contemporary linguistic, psychodynamic, and phenomenological approaches, I focus on the lexical and semantic resources typical of highland Maya dream talk, illustrating the way these resources can be used to pragmatically negotiate questions of volition and authorial responsibility in relation to dream experience. By locating experience at a distance from the speaker, this framing provides an expressive resource for managing—mitigating, diffusing, or even disclaiming—agentic responsibility for described events or experiences, particularly those with significant implications for social status or self-definition. I close with reflections on the interpretive potential of an integrative “cultural psychodynamic” approach, one that draws on discourse-analytic, ethnographic, and psychoanalytic methods and theories in the service of understanding complex cultural subjectivities. Keywords: *Chiapas; highland Maya; dreaming; agency; ethnopsychology; evidentiality; narrative; cultural psychodynamics*•••

**Timothy K. Choy**, **Lieba Faier**, **Michael J. Hathaway**, **Miyako Inoue**, **Shiho Satsuka**, and **Anna Tsing**, May 2009, “A new form of collaboration in cultural anthropology: Matsutake worlds.” American Ethnologist vol. 36 (issue 2): 380-403. (link: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1425.2009.01141.x/abstract text: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1425.2009.01141.x/abstract) ABSTRACT Experiments in collaboration open new investigative possibilities for cultural anthropologists. In this report, we use our research on matsutake mushrooms to show the promise of collaborative experiments for ethnographers of scale making, global connection, and human–nonhuman relations. Anna Tsing introduces. Mogu Mogu (Timothy Choy and Shiho Satsuka) argue that the mushroomic figure of mycorrhizal life illuminates workings of capital and power, nature and culture. Lieba Faier examines contingency—through the effect of weather and bugs on matsutake production—as a form of self-positioning that emerges from local understandings of connection. Michael Hathaway uses postcolonial science studies to examine the transnational production, flow, and transformation of scientific knowledge about matsutake. Miyako Inoue discusses the anthropological subject that emerges through the kind of collaboration envisioned and practiced by the Matsutake Worlds Research Group. Keywords: *collaboration, postcolonial science studies, multisited ethnography, naturecultures, contingency, knowledge production*•••

**Stacey A. Langwick**, August 2008, “Articulate(d) bodies: Traditional medicine in a Tanzanian hospital.” American Ethnologist vol. 38 (issue 3): 428-439. (link: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1425.2008.00044.x/abstract text: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1425.2008.00044.x/abstract) ABSTRACT Hospital practitioners in East Africa see traditional and modern medicine interrupt and interfere with one another on hospital grounds everyday. In response, nurses and nurse's aides have developed innovative ways of assembling diverse therapies and the knowledges, practices, desires, and medicines of which they consist. Through their care and coordination, nurses and nurse's aides forge complex bodies within the therapeutic interruptions and interferences they face in their clinical work. Keywords: *traditional medicine, biomedicine, body, ontology, Tanzania, Africa*•••

**Stefan Helmreich**, November 2007, “An anthropologist underwater: Immersive soundscapes, submarine cyborgs, and transductive ethnography.” American Ethnologist vol. 34 (issue 4): 621-641. (link: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/ae.2007.34.4.621/abstract text: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/ae.2007.34.4.621/abstract) ABSTRACT In this article, I deliver a first-person anthropological report on a dive to the seafloor in the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution's three-person submersible, Alvin. I examine multiple meanings of immersion: as a descent into liquid, an absorption in activity, and the all-encompassing entry of an anthropologist into a cultural medium. Tuning in to the rhythms of what I call the “submarine cyborg”—“doing anthropology in sound,” as advocated by Steven Feld and Donald Brenneis (2004)—I show how interior and exterior soundscapes create a sense of immersion, and I argue that a transductive ethnography can make explicit the technical structures and social practices of sounding, hearing, and listening that support this sense of sonic presence. Keywords: *anthropology of science; anthropology of sound; soundscapes; immersion; cyborgs*•••

**Akio Tanabe**, August 2007, “Toward vernacular democracy: Moral society and post-postcolonial transformation in rural Orissa, India.” American Ethnologist vol. 34 (issue 3): 558-574. (link: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/ae.2007.34.3.558/abstract text: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/ae.2007.34.3.558/abstract) ABSTRACT In this article, I consider intercaste negotiations in defining ethically desirable sociopolitical relationships in contemporary Orissa, India. Democratization following local self-government reforms led to the inclusion of hitherto marginalized voices in local political dialogue. Particularly notable is subalterns' employment of egalitarian sacrificial ethics to reinterpret the ontology of caste as founded on participation and cooperation of equal parts rather than on the colonially traditionalized hegemonic values of hierarchy and domination. This may be seen as an attempt to establish a vernacular democracy that mediates embodied sociopolitical morality and the idea and institution of equal participation. Keywords: *democracy; morality; subalterns; postcoloniality; the vernacular; civil society; political society*•••

**Paul Nadasdy**, February 2007, “The gift in the animal: The ontology of hunting and human-animal sociality.” American Ethnologist vol. 34 (issue 1): 25-43. (link: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/ae.2007.34.1.25/abstract text:  http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/ae.2007.34.1.25/abstract) ABSTRACT Many hunting peoples conceive of hunting as a process of reciprocal exchange between hunters and other-than-human persons, and anthropologists have tended to view such accounts as purely symbolic or metaphorical. To the extent that our theories deny the validity of northern hunters' conceptions of animals and the ontological assumptions on which they are based, however, we legitimize agents of the state when they dismiss the possibility that aboriginal knowledge and practices might serve as the factual basis for making wildlife management policy. In this article, I argue that our refusal to consider aboriginal accounts of hunting as perhaps literally as well as metaphorically valid has both contributed to the marginalization of aboriginal peoples and foreclosed important avenues of inquiry into hunting societies and the nature of human–animal relations. I focus on human–animal relations as a form of reciprocal exchange and argue that the development of a theoretical framework that can accommodate northern hunters' ontological assumptions is warranted theoretically as well as politically. Keywords: *hunting; human–animal relations; reciprocity; traditional/indigenous knowledge; ontology; radical participation; Subarctic; Yukon*•••

**Eduardo Kohn**, February 2007, “How dogs dream: Amazonian natures and the politics of transspecies engagement.” American Ethnologist vol. 34 (issue 1): 3-24. (link: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/ae.2007.34.1.3/abstract text: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/ae.2007.34.1.3/abstract) ABSTRACT Under the rubric of an “anthropology of life,” I call for expanding the reach of ethnography beyond the boundaries of the human. Drawing on research among the Upper Amazonian Runa and focusing, for heuristic purposes, on a particular ethnological conundrum concerning how to interpret the dreams dogs have, I examine the relationships, both intimate and fraught, that the Runa have with other lifeforms. Analytical frameworks that fashion their tools from what is unique to humans (language, culture, society, and history) or, alternatively, what humans are commonly supposed to share with animals are inadequate to this task. By contrast, I turn to an embodied and emergentist understanding of semiosis—one that treats sign processes as inherent to life and not just restricted to humans—as well as to an appreciation for Amazonian preoccupations with inhabiting the points of view of nonhuman selves, to move anthropology beyond “the human,” both as analytic and as bounded object of study. Keywords: *anthropology of life; human–animal relations; nonhuman selves; Amazonia; semiotics; perspectivism; multinaturalism*•••

**Laura R. Graham**, November 2005. “Image and instrumentality in a Xavante politics of existential recognition: The public outreach work of EtEnhiritipa Pimentel Barbosa.” American Ethnologist vol. 32 (issue 4): 622-641. (link: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/ae.2005.32.4.622/abstract text:  http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/ae.2005.32.4.622/abstract) ABSTRACT This analysis of one Xavante group's innovative projects to represent Xavante culture to nonindigenous audiences reveals multiple and complex perceptions of instrumentalities as well as political goals. Unlike many contemporary Native (Amazonian and other) groups that use aspects of their culture to attract support and achieve concrete political goals, local objectives are relatively abstract and future oriented, having to do with public “image” and “existential recognition.” Analysis illustrates that local ideas about indigenous cultural displays aimed primarily at nonindigenous audiences, including “identity politics” and apparently straightforward cultural commodification, may not neatly correspond with anthropologists' or other outsiders' expectations. Overly narrow interpretive foci may cause anthropologists to overlook the potential for multiple and complex objectives and a diversity of locally significant dimensions. Keywords: *Native Amazonia, (Brazil), identity politics, politics of recognition, existential recognition, performance, public sphere, cultural commodification*•••

**Fred Myers**, February 2004, “Ontologies of the image and economies of exchange.” American Ethnologist vol. 31 (issue 1): 5-20. (link: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/ae.2004.31.1.5/abstract text:  http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/ae.2004.31.1.5/abstract) ABSTRACT In the early 1970s, the Aboriginal artist and activist Wandjuk Marika asked the Australian government to investigate the unauthorized use of Yolngu clan designs on a variety of commodity forms, inaugurating a process of recognizing Indigenous ownership of “copyright” in such designs. This treatment of design—and of culture—as a form of property involves understandings and practices of materiality and subjectivity that differ from those informing indigenous, Aboriginal relationships to cultural production and circulation. In this article I explore the significance for material culture theory of recent work on and events in the development of notions of cultural property. One of my main concerns is the relevance of local understandings of objectification, or objectness, and human action—as embedded in object-ideologies. I discuss the limited capacity of legal discourses of cultural property to capture and reflect the concerns of Indigenous Australians about their own relation to culture, to creativity, and to expression. Keywords: *art, copyright, materiality, Indigenous Australia*•••

**Stefan Helmreich**, August 2003, “Trees and seas of information: Alien kinship and the biopolitics of gene transfer in marine biology and biotechnology.” American Ethnologist vol. 30 (issue 3): 340-358. (link: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/ae.2003.30.3.340/abstract text:  http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/ae.2003.30.3.340/abstract) ABSTRACT Examining discussions of "lateral gene transfer" in marine biology and biotechnology, I maintain that "natural" bonds between genealogy and classification in biology may be dissolving. I argue that marine microbial biology is good to think about with the rise of new kinships and biopolitics organized less around practices of "sex" than politics of "transfer." I draw on fieldwork among academic and industry marine biologists to explore implications of rhizomatic, informatic, watery articulations of "bare life." Keywords: *biopolitics, kinship, gene transfer, anthropology of science, maritime anthropology, biotechnology*•••

**David M. Smith**, August 1998, “An Athapaskan way of knowing: Chipewyan Ontology.” American Ethnologist vol. 25 (issue 3): 412-432. (link: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/ae.1998.25.3.412/abstract text: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/ae.1998.25.3.412/abstract) ABSTRACT The ontology of those Canadian Chipewyan who still actively hunt, fish, and trap is based on the assumption that one must maintain a harmonious communication with nature, especially with animal persons. To this end, emphasis is placed on paying attention to the full complement of holistically interacting senses, giving more attention to the intuitive and affective realms than is typical for Euro-American ontologies. No single sensorium dominates metaphorically; greatest validity is given to firsthand, experiential knowledge attained in waking life or in dreams, with the powerful stories of the elders serving as guides to understanding. Chipewyan thought is monistic—there are no human/nature, mind/body, thought/action, or spirit/matter dualisms. There is a definite cognitive connection among the inseparability of the senses, an implicit monistic philosophy, the understanding that individual can never be separate from society, social egalitarianism, and the belief in the need for maintaining harmonious communication with animal persons. Keywords: *Chipewyan, ontology, perception, inkonze, monism*•••

**T.M.S. Evens**, February 1985, “The paradox of Nuer feud and the leopard-skin chief: a “creative” solution to the prisoner’s dilemma.” American Ethnologist vol. 12 (issue 1): 84-102. (link: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/ae.1985.12.1.02a00050/abstract text: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/ae.1985.12.1.02a00050/abstract) ABSTRACT It is argued that the study of Nuer feud discloses an existential dilemma the universal aspect of which is suggested by its similarity to the so-called prisoner's dilemma. However, out of keeping with the rationalist spirit in which the prisoner's dilemma is typically presented in Western academic discourse, the Nuer do not attempt to resolve their dilemma once and for all, but instead temporize it: through a creative (arational) move, representatively constituted by the figure of the leopard-skin chief, the Nuer repeatedly put off the dilemma's stultifying implication. The creative twist of the Nuer solution is basically conditioned by the paradoxical constitution of Nuer “reality.” This constitution, in sharp contrast to our own considered ontology, makes logically possible movement between domains — spirit and matter — that appear to us to be perfectly separate and distinct. The resulting practice is what is called here the Nuer folk model. Keywords: *Nuer feud, leopard-skin chief, prisoner's dilemma, folk model, ontology, paradox, East Africa*
