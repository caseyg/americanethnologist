Text: A group of performers, the Castellers de Barcelona, construct a nine-level human tower in Tarragona, Spain, in 2014. Photo: Roberta Esteves FernandezSpain is facing the greatest challenge in the post-Franco era to the nation's constitutional unity, as the Catalonian government in October 2015 issued a motion to unilaterally declare Catalonia's independence. The independence movement helped build support by using a 200-year-old cultural performance, the building of human towers (castells). The movement discarded other cultural performances (soccer, the sardana dance, and fire festivals), drawing from the human towersâ€™ performative iconicity, associational culture, affective dimensions, and operative values to rally disparate social groups behind independence. In using human towers, the movement envisioned a solution to the ideological divisions of nationalist politics, but the instrumentalization of culture has a contradictory effect on politics. As European secessionist movements intensify, cultural performances reveal the objectives and risks of nationalist constructions.
