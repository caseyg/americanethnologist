Caption: A Cuban passport issued to Miguel Wasersztein y Kromberg on August 21, 1936, when he was 23 years old. This beautifully rendered document represents one leg in my father's long transnational journey across a violent century. Inside its gold‐lettered, leather‐bound cover, there is a 12 × 10‐inch sheet of high‐quality paper, textured like fabric, folded into eighths to fit between the front and back cover. Material in this passport gives the names of Miguel's father as Ajzk, mother as Priwa, and his hometown as Jebwagne, Polonia, and it includes my father's signature and an incredibly beautiful photograph of him.
