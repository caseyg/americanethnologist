Text: Plasticity has conceptually guided much research on the adult human brain since the late 1990s. The emergence of this idea has catapulted the neurosciences beyond the synaptic, chemical conception of the brain, its diseases, and its humans that dominated the second half of the 20th century. I explore the figure of what I call the “neurological human” to bring such mutations of the neuroscientific order of knowledge into a sharp analytical focus.
