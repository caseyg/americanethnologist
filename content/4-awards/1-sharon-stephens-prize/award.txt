Title: Sharon Stephens Prize

----

Text: 

Every two years the AES invites nominations for its bi-annual Sharon Stephens Prize, awarded for a junior scholar’s first book. The prize ($1000) goes to a work that speaks to contemporary social issues with relevance beyond the discipline and beyond the academy. 

Ethnographies and critical works in contemporary theory–single-authored or multi-authored but not edited collections–are eligible.

The jury for the prize is chaired by an AES councilor, who selects two or three other scholars as jury members.

Letters of nominations must come from scholars; self-nominations and nominations from presses are not invited.  

Announcements regarding the deadlines and other specifics will be posted on this website, as well as through the Anthropology News “AES Section News” column and other e-mail based publicity. 

The Sharon Stephens Prize is awarded at the AES business meeting at the AAA annual meeting.

The next competition round will be in 2017.
