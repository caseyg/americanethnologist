Title: Sharon Stephens Prize

----

Text: 

Every two years the AES invites nominations for its bi-annual Sharon Stephens Prize, awarded for a junior scholar’s first book. The prize ($1000) goes to a work that speaks to contemporary social issues with relevance beyond the discipline and beyond the academy. Ethnographies and critical works in contemporary theory–single-authored or multi-authored but not edited collections–are eligible. The Sharon Stephens Prize is awarded at the AES business meeting at the AAA annual meeting.

The next competition round will be in 2017.
