)The prize committee, consisting of Marc Edelman (co-chair, CUNY), Shalini Shankar (co-chair, Northwestern U), Tine Gammeltoft (U Copenhagen), and Elizabeth Ferry (Brandeis U), wrote the following about Land’s End: Tania Murray Li’s Land’s End, based on intensive, long-term field research in Indonesia, is a powerful and poignant account of how Lauje highlanders embraced cash cropping, privatized their commons and set in motion new and largely unanticipated processes of class differentiation, social exclusion, exploitation and migration. Tragically, it was not corporate land grabbers or the Indonesian state that initiated these shifts, but rather the highlanders themselves, who dreamed of a better life and hoped to enter their imagined version of modernity. Land’s End is a powerful critique of both conventional development prescriptions that see market relations as a panacea for rural poverty and of social movement agendas that stress indigenous rights, environmental protection and food sovereignty.
