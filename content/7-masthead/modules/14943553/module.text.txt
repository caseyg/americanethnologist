## AAA & AES Sponsorship

The American Ethnologist is sponsored by the American Ethnological Society (AES), which was founded in 1842 in New York City and is now one of dozens of subsections of the American Anthropological Association. The AES is a national organization with international reach. Read A Brief History of AES on the American Ethnological Society website.

With the support of the American Anthropological Associationâ€™s executive board, the journal American Ethnologist was created in 1972 to publish articles on socio-cultural anthropology. When the American Ethnological Society (AES) was incorporated into the American Anthropological Association in the early 1980s, the AES became the AAA section sponsoring the journal.
