Title: Aims & Scope

----

Text: 

American Ethnologist is concerned with ethnology in the term’s broadest sense. Articles published in the journal explore connections between ethnographic specificity and theoretical originality, and convey the relevance of the ethnographic imagination to the contemporary world.

As a flagship journal for social and cultural anthropology, American Ethnologist  is well positioned to disseminate work that roams across an extraordinary variety of theoretical approaches, methods, and points of view. The editor encourages submission of manuscripts that reflect the discipline’s intellectual diversity.

Today that means publishing imaginative scholarship on topics ranging from multi-species ethnography to studies of finance, affect, violence, citizenship, new media, post-socialism, popular culture, social movements, sexuality, transnationalism, the body, biomedicine, law, religion, and neoliberalism (among many others).   It also means exploring vital forms of anthropological engagement with public debates on issues such as corporate social responsibility, global economic crisis, organ trafficking, internet neutrality, and the corporatization of universities.  Also welcome are manuscripts that embody new forms of collaboration in anthropology, such as the “work-in-progress” contribution in the May 2009 AE issue, by the Matsutake Worlds Research Group (authors Anna Tsing, Timothy Choy, Shiho Satsuka, Lieba Faier, Michael Hathaway, and Miyako Inoue).

Authors are welcome to submit online supplements to their articles, such as video and audio clips, photographs, and interview transcripts by sending them to americanethnologist.org@gmail.com. Article manuscripts should not be sent to this email address.
