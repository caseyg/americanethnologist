The panel discussion is on the following: As inequality ramps up globally, the new politics of austerity reduces government’s role in supporting the poor, seeking instead to encourage responsibility. This distinguished panel will discuss ethnographies of the urban poor to consider the possibilities of resilience and the effects of austerity in combating contemporary urban poverty. **AAA Faculty-Student Workshops:** Deadline Oct. 1 AES will sponsor five faculty-student workshops at the Chicago AAA meetings.
