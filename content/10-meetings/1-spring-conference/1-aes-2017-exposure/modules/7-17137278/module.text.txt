##Additional Information

####Badges, Final Program, & On-site Registration
Printed copies of AES17’s final program, conference badges, and on-site registration will be available starting noon, Thursday, March 30th, at the conference check-in desk, which will be located at [building 50](https://campus-map.stanford.edu/?id=01-050&lat=37.42696071&lng=-122.16991448&zoom=17&srch=building%2050), home of Stanford’s Anthro. Department.  

####Location of Panels
The university’s Main Quad will be the roost for all panels.  Panels will occur in classrooms in or near the Anthro. Department, where you’ll find the AES17 check-in desk (see above).  We are now finalizing room assignments for panels, workshops, and plenaries.  Room assignments will be printed in the final program.

####Helpful App
Consider downloading the “[Stanford Mobile](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.stanford.m&hl=en)” app, which offers useful info like maps, schedules of free shuttles, and dining locations.
