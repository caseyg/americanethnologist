Stanford has a fleet of free shuttles – called the Marguerite – that run regularly Monday-Friday (with lesser service on weekends).  The “Palo Alto transit center” is the closest stop for the Cardinal Hotel.  Marguerite service also extends up to the SU Guesthouse, and the Guesthouse has its own small van seating 5 people. In terms of the nearest drop off spots on campus for reaching Building 50 of the Main Quad (the conference venue), we recommend either the “Oval/Serra Mall” or the “Faculty Club”.

**Line “P”:** express running from Palo Alto Transit Center to the Oval every 5-10 minutes in the morning, every 10-20 minutes mid-day, every 5-10 in late afternoon. 6:30AM-9:20PM
