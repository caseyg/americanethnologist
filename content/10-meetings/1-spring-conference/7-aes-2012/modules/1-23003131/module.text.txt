###Theme: Anthropologists Engage the World
AES calls for papers, panels, roundtables, workshops, walking tours and posters that explore how anthropologists, through theory and practice engage the crucial issues, movements, institutions and debates facing our world. The conference invites panels and roundtables that focus on emerging theoretical fields as well as the work of prominent theorists in anthropology. The conference aims to explore and assess anthropologyâ€™s capacity to make important interventions in public issues and shape global realities, whether through fieldwork, social critique, applied practice, activism, university teaching, public education, media engagement, or advocacy. Drawing upon the AES core commitment to combine innovative fieldwork and rich theoretical critique, the conference will consider how to elevate into the public sphere the basic research, theoretical analysis and attention to local-global intersections that are the hallmarks of anthropology.

Venue: Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT) Dubinsky Conference Center at W. 27th Street between 7th and 8th Avenue in midtown Manhattan.
