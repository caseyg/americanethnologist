Intro: The AES Editorial Intern Team will launch at the AES spring meeting in Washington, DC March 31-April 2. The team will work with AES Section Editor Carole McGranahan to introduce new features and conversations to our website and social media. We welcome your ideas, and in the future will be inviting applications for other graduate students to join us. At the AAA conference in Minneapolis this fall we will hold an open meeting for all interested in learning more.
