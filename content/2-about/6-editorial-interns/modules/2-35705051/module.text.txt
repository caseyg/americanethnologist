**Amiel Bize** is a PhD candidate in Anthropology at Columbia University, where she also completed her undergraduate degree in Comparative Literature. Her dissertation research focuses on “black spots”—stretches of road where accidents happen frequently—along rural highways in Kenya. The project uses roads and road danger as a lens onto shifting rural landscapes in Kenya, where ideas of kinship, temporality, and morality are being reconfigured to accommodate the risks and opportunities of the post-austerity economy. The project proposes that, as infrastructure construction comes to stand in for development, roads are a key site for understanding the mix of state withdrawal and investment that characterizes contemporary Kenya, as well as the ways in which rural populations are affected by and responding to these shifts. She is also interested in venues for presenting her work beyond academia, and in past has created documentary films and radio essays.

**Chelsey Carter** is a third-year doctoral student in anthropology and a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow at Washington University in St. Louis. Prior to the onset of her doctoral studies, Chelsey worked with various non-profit and for profit organizations around the United States. Her background includes a demonstrated interest in healthcare services, human resources, employee benefits, healthcare reform, youth leadership education, high human touch services and applied medical anthropology. She has employed these interests and skills in her various positions with Global Youth Leadership Institute, Muscular Dystrophy Association, CARE USA, HisGrip Home Care, Northwestern Mutual, and Washington University School of Medicine. Her research examines the intersections of race, class, gender, and chronic illness in the U.S. Her forthcoming project will examine how black people with neuromuscular diseases (like ALS) navigate healthcare spaces and experience care by healthcare institutions in St. Louis. Her work also considers how anti-black racism stifles health and further promotes health inequities for black people. She is a chief advocate for the use of ethnographic tools and methodologies to solve many of society’s most vexing concerns. She received her Bachelor’s in Anthropology with high honors and a minor in Spanish from Emory University, where she was a Mellon Mays Undergraduate Fellow. She also earned her Master’s in Anthropology from Washington University in St. Louis. When not pursuing academic interests, she enjoys cooking, reading, working out and traveling internationally.

**Bryan Dougan** is a PhD student in the Department of Anthropology at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. His ethnographic work considers the ways in which humanitarian and global health knowledge and standards shape the practices surrounding psychiatric care in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Taking the urban as the site of psychiatric practice, his project seeks to examine how patients, families, doctors, and global health researchers grapple with providing care and conducting research in a rapidly developing African city. Originally from Baltimore, he holds a bachelor’s degree from Franklin & Marshall College and a master’s in public health from Johns Hopkins University.

**Alison Hanson** is a PhD student in Cultural Anthropology at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Her interests include gender, social movements, justice, sexual violence, embodiment, and intimacy in South Asia and the United States. Alison’s current research examines how Indian feminist projects against sexual violence enact visions of gender justice both within and beyond the law. Specifically, she has conducted preliminary fieldwork with NGOs, lawyers, scholars, and student activists in New Delhi to explore how feminist politics manifest in different social spheres. She investigates the creative forms of action and solidarity building that undergird Indian women’s politics through a transnational and intersectional feminist lens. She comes to these research interests after working for women’s empowerment with fair trade artisans in India and through her own personal involvement in social justice advocacy. Alison is committed to engaged scholarship and producing knowledge that can be useful for multiple publics both in and outside the academy. She received an MA in Anthropology and a Graduate Certificate in Women’s and Gender Studies from the University of Colorado, Boulder and a BA in Business Economics from UCLA.

**Tara Joly** is a PhD Candidate in Social Anthropology at the University of Aberdeen, Scotland. Her research interests include environmental management, indigenous rights, history of science, and industrial landscapes in subarctic Canada. Based on archival research and fieldwork in Fort McMurray, Canada with the McMurray Métis community and peatland scientists, Tara’s research addresses oil sands wetland reclamation as an emergent form of cultural encounter between divergent epistemologies. Using muskeg as an analytical tool in her doctoral thesis, she traces definitions of landscape utility held by Métis community members, scientists, government agents, and industry representatives. Drawing on environmental anthropology and critical geography literature, she argues that Métis community members are actively and creatively asserting their sovereignty in their homeland that is often conceived as an extractive zone. This research is informed by Tara’s parallel work as an applied anthropologist in the region, in which she assists with a number of Métis Land-Use studies, technical document reviews, and oral history projects in Fort McMurray. Tara is excited to be part of the AES intern team and explore how social media might be a platform through which to foster respectful and accountable research dialogues between academic, community, and public spaces.

**José A. Romero** is a PhD student in Cultural Anthropology at Duke University. His research interests include political ecology, securitization, and mobilities across the Americas. His current project explores the eco-poetics of both community-organized, volunteer, armed self-defense groups (autodefensas) in Mexico and the economic diversification of drug cartels into illegal mining and logging. This project primarily works with agricultural laborers in the US, autodefensa and broader community members in Michoacán, Latinx deportees and their transnational families, and will involve facing corporate officials from mining and other relevant industries. The child of immigrant agricultural laborers, José is indebted to critiques of human borders drawing on the Black Radical Tradition, Native Feminisms, and Queer studies. José is elated to join the internship team and the wider American Ethnological Society community.

**Sonja Trifuljesko** is a third-year Doctoral Candidate in Social and Cultural Anthropology at the University of Helsinki, Finland. She obtained her previous degrees in Ethnology and Anthropology, as well as in Art History from the University of Belgrade, Serbia. Sonja’s research interests are rather diverse. Initially, she was primarily engaging with anthropological theories of body and anthropology of policy. Her MA thesis investigated the manner in which disability was socially constructed in Serbia and the manner in which it was lived – through the ‘bodies with disability’. Towards the end of her master’s studies, Sonja has started developing a strong interest in migration theories. In 2011, she conducted a brief study on the values of young adults of Serbian origin in Vienna, Austria. Her doctoral project, however, attempts to make a contribution to anthropological discussions on the contemporary university reform. She has just completed her long-term ethnographic fieldwork and expects to defend her thesis in 2018. By capturing different forms that the popular concept of ‘internationalization’ take within the University of Helsinki, Sonja’s study aims to understand and explain present-day transformation of Finnish universities, as well as to interpret its social, cultural and political implications.

**Namgyal Tsepak** is a PhD Candidate in the Department of Anthropology at Cornell University, with a Minor in American Indian Studies. Originally from northeastern Tibet, Namgyal graduated from Duke University (Durham, NC) with a B.A. in Anthropology. He spent a research and service-learning year at Seva Foundation (Berkeley, CA) as a Research Associate through Duke University’s Hart Fellows Program. Namgyal had managed community development grants including from the Canada Fund, the Davis Projects for Peace, and DukeEngage to implement solar energy projects in Tibetan and other ethnic minority areas in Qinghai, Sichuan and Gansu provinces in western China. For his dissertation research, Namgyal works with the Stockbridge-Munsee Mohican Nation (Bowler, Wisconsin) to investigate the ways in which the Mohican people today reconnect with their ancestral homelands in the Northeast, and explore how lands/places intersect with Native identity, sociocultural (re)production and political belonging within the context of settler colonialism. In addition to his dissertation research, Namgyal periodically translates writings by prominent Tibetan writers and social activists. He shares some of these translations and his own writing excerpts on at his Nomadic Borders blog. He has contributed articles to journals such as Central Asiatic Journal, Cultural Survival Quarterly, and Asian Highlands Perspectives.
