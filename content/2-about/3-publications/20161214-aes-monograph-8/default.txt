Transforming Academia:   
Challenges and Opportunities for an Engaged Anthropology
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 By Linda G. Basch, Lucie Wood Saunders, Jagna Wojcika Sharff, and James Peacock, eds. Transforming Academia is an ethnography of higher education by authors located at the highest levels of academic administration and teaching. It addresses the structural and cultural transformations presently challenging academia, and identifies ways anthropologists, using the tools of the discipline, can bring anthropological analyses and perspectives to the discourse of higher education. It also urges and provides several examples of how anthropologists can become part of the solution in their own institutions.
