# #Ferguson Supplement: Educator Resources

Educators have turned to social media to find ways to confront the events in Ferguson, especially to create dynamic syllabi that can respond quickly to events on the ground. Whether considering an entire course, a school-wide teach-in, or just one class, the way educators choose to frame their response to #Ferguson will have important effects on the way we remember and the way we mobilize. - (link: https://www.zotero.org/groups/ferguson text: Bibliographic Resources about Ferguson)
