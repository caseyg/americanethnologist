Text:
Traditional Maori meeting houses adapted to urban areas help to create communities that are able to represent themselves as analogous to rural ones centered on descent. Such representations have impact beyond the claims they embody in a “politics of culture”: By providing frames for the interpretation of experience, they contribute to the ways in which the embrace of identity becomes a process of self-making, leading to “revived” cultures that shape actors’ ways of being and thinking in the world and, thus, their political struggles and goals. This outcome has implications for the future of cultural diversity.
