Courtesy of the artist.The visible and the unseen are states of growing anthropological engagement, as this selection of articles published in American Ethnologist in 2012 and 2013 clearly shows. “In/visibility,” the theme of the 2014 AES spring meeting, organized in collaboration with the Society for Visual Anthropology, looks to visibilization and concealment, and their ambiguous thresholds, as prompts to new questions in the domains of politics, the economy, religion, media, social inequality, citizenship, security, human rights, and humanitarianism. Those emergent questions insist that visibility and invisibility are active processes, not merely empirical states or static qualities of appearance or nonappearance. The articles in this virtual issue of AE draw on a thread that ties creative contemporary sociocultural engagements in anthropology to older questions of method, meaning, and representation, in a renewed exploration of concealment and revelation, silence and disclosure, manifestation and latency, and their boundaries and transformations as forces in the constitution of cultural worldviews and social categories and inequalities. At issue in these articles and in other recent AE articles are current public controversies about “dark sites” in politics, national security, and law; shadow, alien, and regulated forms within citizenship and the environment; techniques of legibility and surveillance and their evasion; visual media’s growing influence; and the hopes and fears pinned on emerging technologies. ### Silence and disclosure in knowledge/power regimes
