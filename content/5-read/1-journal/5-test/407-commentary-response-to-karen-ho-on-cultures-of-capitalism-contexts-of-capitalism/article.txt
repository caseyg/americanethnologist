 The anthropology of capitalism requires ethnographic attention to capitalism at key sites of its production, as well as analytic recognition of the compulsive force of capitalism as it is produced and reproduced through a multitude of connected practices. This reply to Karen Ho’s commentary on my AE article “Managing the Margins” addresses the tensions between approaching capitalism as context and as an emergent cultural production, and the challenges of engaging with “native categories”—such as “risk”—that blur with terms of critical analysis.
