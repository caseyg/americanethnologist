) Didier Fassin: La force de l'ordreResearch generally ends with the publication of its results. What happens to it afterward is implicitly viewed as the usual after-sales service of science. Yet its encounter with various audiences, the debates it raises, and the new perspectives it opens can be collectively regarded as an object of inquiry in its own right. In this essay, I embark on an analysis of the public afterlife of ethnography. Rather than promote public social science, I examine what it is, the operations it entails, the questions it poses, and the challenges and limitations it faces. Drawing principally from public engagement with and reception of two recent books on urban policing and the carceral condition in France, I discuss the meaning and significance of afterlife, the multiple configurations of and interactions with publics, and the specific issues related to the publicization of ethnography. ######  Note on the image: In prestigious series of French academic books, the design of the cover is spare, simply showing the title and author on a white background (see, e.g., titles in the series “Bibliothèque des sciences humaines,” “Hautes études,” or, here, “La couleur des idées”). Whereas Le Seuil, the publisher of La force de l’ordre, wanted to issue the book in a more popular series, I insisted it be part of an academic one to secure its afterlife as a social science monograph, even at the risk of reducing its public impact. Le Seuil subsequently reissued the French edition in its pocket series of classics, called “Points,” which have more-graphical images: The choice of image for the volume was allusive: a bit of graffiti.
