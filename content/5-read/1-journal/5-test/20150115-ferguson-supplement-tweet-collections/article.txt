Different hashtag campaigns have served as modes of bearing witness, mobilizing action, or claiming an identification. From #Ferguson to #LastWords, #MillionsMarch, or even #CrimingWhileWhite and #NoAngel, the various hashtags surrounding Ferguson, and the conversations they signal, help us better make sense of the various publics and counterpublics that emerged in the wake of Michael Brown's killing.
