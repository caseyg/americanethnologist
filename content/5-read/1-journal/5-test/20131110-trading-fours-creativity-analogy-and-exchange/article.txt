 In commenting on Eitan Wilf's “Sociable robots, jazz music, and divination,” I consider contemporary practices of spontaneous algorithmic composition designed to help produce new, unpredictable, and “interesting” jazz music. I focus, in particular, on five themes that emerge in Wilf's article: emotion, grooves and grooving, routinization, affordances and constraints, and analogy as both cultural practice and theory-making strategy. I also draw on a comparison between the emergent compositional practices Wilf documents and ethnographic accounts of other improvisatory practices in jazz.
