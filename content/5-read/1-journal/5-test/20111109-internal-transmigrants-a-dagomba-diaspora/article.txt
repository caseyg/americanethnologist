Text:
In this article, I focus on a tiny elite community of Dagomba from Ghana's Northern Region. These men (and a handful of women) were among the first to attend secondary school once it was established in the North. Highly visible professionals, these Dagomba are internal migrants, whose new world in Accra is socially and spatially vastly different from the old in the hometown area of Dagbon. Members of this diaspora are cosmopolitans, intermingling with new kinds of people and transforming ideas and practices, but, at the same time, they maintain complex social relationships with their home communities, serving as a bridge between home and host societies.
