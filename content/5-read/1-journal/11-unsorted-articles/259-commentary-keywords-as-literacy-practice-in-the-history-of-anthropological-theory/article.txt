 Word clouds generated from the keywords and titles of articles published in *American Ethnologist* in the years 1982, 1992, 2002, and 2012 offer a fascinating, though partial, history of anthropological theory over the past several decades. Keyword selection also, I argue, constitutes a type of literacy practice that has been underanalyzed. In this commentary, I explore some of the ways in which the article keyword selection process is imbued with social, intellectual, political, and economic dimensions. I compare the most frequently appearing words in titles versus keywords for each of the above four years and trace the progression of two clusters of keywords: one related to language, the other related to the triumvirate of race, class, and gender.
