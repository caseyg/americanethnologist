By Jessica Winegar In this commentary, I challenge assumptions about political transformation by contrasting womenâ€™s experiences at home during the Egyptian revolution with the image of the iconic male revolutionary in Tahrir Square. I call attention to the way that revolution is experienced and undertaken in domestic spaces, through different forms of affect, in ways deeply inflected by gender and class.
