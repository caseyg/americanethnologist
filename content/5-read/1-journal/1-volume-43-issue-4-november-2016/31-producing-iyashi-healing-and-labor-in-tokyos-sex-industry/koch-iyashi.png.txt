Caption: A billboard located prominently across from a train platform at busy Shibuya Station, Tokyo, July 2011. In this advertisement for Vanilla, an employment website for the sex industry, the “cute” graphics highlight innocence, naïveté, and access to a consumer lifestyle. The text reads in part, “Get information on high-paying work!! I want to earn more! I really love money! Access us now and get information by searching ‘vanilla’ and ‘wanted ads.’
