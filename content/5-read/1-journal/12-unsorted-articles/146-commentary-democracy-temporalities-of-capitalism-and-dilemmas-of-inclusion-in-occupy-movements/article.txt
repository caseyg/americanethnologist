By David Nugent The two articles in this issue that I consider here raise fascinating questions about the temporalities of capitalism and about the dilemmas of inclusion in the recent Occupy movements. I explore some of these questions by focusing on three features of the movements: their temporal registers, their moral imaginaries, and their implicit and explicit understandings of democracy. I connect these different threads by showing their relationships to one another and also to what activists believe Occupy has emerged in opposition to: the interrelated crises of global capitalism and representative democracy. <figure>
