 Pursuing a self-described anarcho-surrealist politics in the aftermath of Iceland’s banking crisis, Jón Gnarr shocked the country’s political establishment by winning the mayoral election in Reykjavík in May 2010. In this article, I explore the rise of Gnarr’s Best Party, especially its refusal to accept a distinction between parody and sincerity in its mode of political performance. Against the backdrop of the increasing monopolization of (neo)liberal political discourse and action, I discuss how “Gnarrism” reflects at once something old and something new in northern liberal democracy. **(link: http://www.americanethnologist.org/2013/dominic-boyer-interviews-mayor-of-reykjavik/ text: Read Dominic Boyer's supplemental interview with Jón Gnarr, mayor of Reykjavík)** <figure>
