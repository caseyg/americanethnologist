    The competition, in its inaugural year, received almost 200 proposals, and the committee was challenged to select from a pool of very worthy projects. The award of $2500 is to fund dissertation research. Grantees will be encouraged to write a brief, blog-style report on project findings for the AES website, and an additional $500 will be available to grantees who present their work at the 2019 AES spring meeting: March 14 to 16, 2019 at Washington University in St. Louis, co-hosted by the Association of Black Anthropologists (ABA) and the Association of Latino and Latina Anthropologists (ALLA).
    
    AES plans to run the competition again in 2019.

    ####Alia Ayman
    #####(New York University)
    
    Ayman’s research examines the history of Egyptian documentary films commissioned by the state after the 1952 revolution. The research explores the politics and poetics of representing cultural difference through examining a vast corpus of short films, newsreels and non-theatrical films that were integral to the project of post-colonial nation building led by Gamal Abd El Nasser.

    ####Ernesto J. Benítez
    #####(Florida International University)
    
    Benítez’s research analyzes the impact that participation in ecotourism, and particularly increasing opportunities for intimate encounters with foreign women, is having on how young Kichwa tour guides in the Ecuadorian Amazon present themselves as indigenous individuals and as men. The research will illuminate notions that drive (mostly white) female tourists' desires for short-term sexual intimacy; the ways in which indigenous men – particularly tour guides – have responded to these new economic and intimate opportunities; and the ways these encounters are shifting understandings of indigenous masculinity and sexuality among the broader population.

    ####Bianca Romagnoli
    #####(University of California, Los Angeles)
    
    Romagnoli’s research examines the experiences of Indigenous communities living in northern Canada who join the Canadian Rangers as part of the larger military mission to establish Canadian sovereignty in the arctic. As political and economic interests shift, so do the lives of the indigenous communities in the area. Romagnoli will analyze how political and personal stakes in indigenous sovereignty are juxtaposed to those of the Canadian state.
