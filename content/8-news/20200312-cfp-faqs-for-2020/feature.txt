    <u><h4>FAQs</h4></u>
    
    <strong>I’ve never written a research proposal before. Can you provide any guidance?</strong>
    
    One of the best short guides is On the Art of Writing Proposals by Adam Pzreworski and Frank Salomon. You may download it (link: https://www.ssrc.org/publications/view/7A9CB4F4-815F-DE11-BD80-001CC477EC70/ text: here.) Another excellent short guide is Karen Kelsky’s (link: https://theprofessorisin.com/2011/07/05/dr-karens-foolproof-grant-template/ text: <i>“Foolproof Grant Template.” </i>)
    <br>
    <strong>Two double-spaced pages doesn’t seem like much for explaining a research project as complex as mine. What happens if I go a little bit over the limit?</strong>
    
    AES runs this competition with a very small selection committee and no support staff. Last year we received almost 200 applications. We need to keep submissions concise. Any proposal that goes over the two-page limit or that otherwise fails to conform to the specifications above will not be considered. An advisor’s letter should be short and indicate clearly that the student is in the first year of their PhD studies at time of application
    
    If you have trouble fitting your proposal into two pages, we recommend that you study Revising <i>Prose</i> by Richard Lanham. A succinct summary of Lanham’s method is (link: https://people.umass.edu/curtis/academics/editingtoolbox/Lanham_LardFactor.pdf text: here.) This will help you eliminate extra words and will likely improve your proposal. Do not include epigraphs, tables, maps, lengthy block quotations or other material that might be suitable for a longer text.
    <br>
    <strong>Do I have to be a citizen of the United States or matriculated in a U.S. university to apply for this grant?</strong>
    
    No. Applicants may be citizens of any country or stateless persons. They must be studying in a graduate program, but this can be anywhere in the world.
    <br>
    <strong>I transferred to my current university after study in another PhD program. Does that disqualify me?</strong>
    
    No. As long as you have first year PhD student status in your current university, you are eligible.
    <br>
    <strong>My advisor is very busy, very important, and/or traveling abroad. Is it okay if she/he submits the letter a few days or hours after the deadline?</strong>
    
    No. The deadline is absolutely firm. Request a letter from your advisor well in advance of the deadline.
    <br>
    <strong>Will AES consider a grant application from someone who already has another small grant? </strong>
    
    Our preference is to use the AES grants as seed money for graduate student researchers who do not have other funding for their projects. In exceptional cases, where a project has a high budget and a suitable justification for it, we will consider applicants who already have one other small grant from their universities or another source.
    <br>
    <strong>My project is ethnographic, but I am in cultural studies, sociology or other doctoral program. Will AES consider my application?</strong>
    
    If the project addresses questions of interest to anthropologists and employs ethnographic and related methods, AES may consider your application.
    <br>
    <strong>My advisor is on the AES board and may be on the selection committee. Does this give me an edge in the competition?</strong>
    
    No. Selection committee members are conscientious about recusing themselves from consideration of proposals that might raise conflict of interest issues for them.
