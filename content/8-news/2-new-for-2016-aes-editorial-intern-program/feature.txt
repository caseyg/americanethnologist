    We are pleased to announce the formation of an American Ethnological Society editorial intern program for anthropology graduate students. Intern responsibilities will include creative intellectual teamwork on social media such as Facebook and Twitter, as well as generating new content for the AE/AES website. Our goal is to expand conversations about anthropology in general, and also to share and supplement the rich body of scholarship produced in the pages of *American Ethnologist*. Grad students involved in the first year will work closely with AES Section Editor Carole McGranahan and other interns to shape and grow the intern program—this will be an exciting time to lay the groundwork for years to come. Prospective interns must be enrolled in an M.A. or Ph.D. program in cultural or social anthropology. Fluency in social media is essential, as is regular and reliable internet access. We currently envision the intern program to be a two-year commitment, with the possibility of extending one’s internship longer if desired.

    ### Application Process:

     To apply to the AES Editorial Intern Program, please send the following materials to Carole McGranahan (carole.mcgranahan at colorado dot edu) by Monday, February 1: - a current CV
    - a 300-500 word statement introducing yourself, your research interests, stage in your graduate studies, and why you would like to be an AES Editorial Intern. For example, what sort of initiatives would you like to work on or create?

     Applicants will be notified of their status in mid-February. The Editorial Intern team will begin its work soon after, including meeting at the (link: http://aesonline.org/meetings/spring-conference/ text: **AES spring meeting in Washington DC, March 31-April 2**).
