Interested in getting involved with the discipline in a new way? Consider joining the (link: http://americanethnologist.org/about/editorial-interns text: American Ethnological Society Editorial Intern program for anthropology graduate students). We are pleased to announce we are now accepting applications through November 1. Intern responsibilities include creative intellectual teamwork at annual conferences, on social media such as Facebook and Twitter, as well as generating new content for the (link: http://americanethnologist.org/ text: AE/AES website). Our goal is to expand conversations about anthropology in general, and also to share and supplement the rich body of scholarship produced in the pages of American Ethnologist. Current projects include AE author interviews, curating collection of essays, writing and editing online essays, hosting AE/AES social media accounts, and creative participation in and reporting from the annual AAA and AES meetings. The AES Editorial Intern program began in 2016, and is currently composed of grad students from universities around the world.

Prospective interns must be enrolled in a PhD program in socio-cultural anthropology. Fluency in social media is essential, as is regular and reliable internet access. Participation in the intern program is a two-year commitment, with the possibility of extending oneâ€™s internship longer if desired.
