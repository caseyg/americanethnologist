This is a collection of all interface elements and modules including HTML and CSS for the (link: http://getkirby.com/blog/kirby-2-beta text: Kirby 2 Panel).

The collection is work in progress and will be extended with each new version of the panel. Feel free to submit any pull requests if you find bugs or possible enhancements.

All modules are open-source and can be reused in your own projects as long as you don't just copy the design of the panel.

This styleguide is based on (link: http://patternlab.io/ text: Brad Frost's amazing Patternlab), ported to Kirby. Check out the repository for more details.
